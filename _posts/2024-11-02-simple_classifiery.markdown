---

This is a simple image classifier. It attempts to differentiate between images of healthy and sick forests.

The model was trained using about 200 images, 100 for each class. The images were selected from the duckduckgo search engine.
Many optimizations could be made, however the purpose of this app is simply to have created something and display it as a webapp.
