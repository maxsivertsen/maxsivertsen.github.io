Extracting trends from data, simply done.

This website serves to offer you more information on the type of work that I perform. Taking basic datasets, different model performance metrics are extracted and compared to demonstrate their applicibility in various use-cases.

For any questions, please reach me at maximussivertsen@gmail.com

Any demonstrated code is provided on my github - max.sivertsen.github
