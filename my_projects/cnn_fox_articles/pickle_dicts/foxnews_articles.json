Tim Walz\u2019s record. Under Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's watch during the COVID-19 pandemic, Minnesota experienced a devastating impact among its most vulnerable, as 80% of COVID-related deaths in the state occurred among residents of long-term care facilities, including nursing homes and assisted living centers. Critics have taken aim at a policy, also practiced in other states during the pandemic, to allow patients with COVID into nursing homes after they were discharged from hospitals. The policy in place is no longer available on the public-facing Minnesota government website and had to be acquired by the Wayback Machine. \"Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who still require transmission-based precautions for COVID-19 can be transferred to congregate living facilities,\" the policy, acquired by the Wayback Machine, said. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WILL BAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USING PLASTIC CUTLERY TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks during a campaign rally with Vice President Kamala Harris. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) \"It is the recommendation of [Minnesota Department of Health] that patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 can be discharged when clinically indicated and neither discontinuation of transmission-based precautions nor the establishment of two negative COVID-19 tests is required prior to hospital discharge,\" it continued. At one point, around May 2020, over 80% of the state's COVID-19 deaths were among residents of long-term care facilities. Despite this data, Walz doubled down on the policy after the fact. NEW STATE DEPARTMENT DIVERSITY CHIEF BELIEVES US IS A \u2018FAILED HISTORIC MODEL\u2019 WITH A \u2018COLONIZING PAST\u2019 \"This was what everyone was doing. This was not a mistake. It wasn't like no one thought about this. There was complexity in how you deal with this,\" the Democratic governor said in May 2020 while the devastation was ongoing. According to a report from the Star Tribune, nursing homes perceived they were deprioritized in terms of being provided with personal protective equipment (PPE), which was critical to protecting both staff and patients from getting infected. Nursing homes believed they were deprioritized during the COVID pandemic, leading to difficulty controlling the spread of infections. (iStock) The state's Department of Health \"informed providers in April that its emergency stockpile of N95 masks was reserved for \u2018hospital settings only\u2019 and that they should wait until their supplies had dwindled to \u2018zero to three days\u2019 before requesting more gear,\" the report said. \"As an alternative, the state encouraged nursing homes to consider using nonmedical cloth masks and to \u2018connect with local communities for donations,\u2019' it continued. The issue was widespread during the early stages of the COVID pandemic. WHITE DUDES FOR HARRIS BRINGS OUT CELEBS; MYTH IN US THAT MEN ARE EXPECTED TO BE 'PROTECTORS AND PROVIDERS' \"Nursing home residents aren\u2019t getting half of our resources or half of our attention, yet they account for roughly half the deaths,\" David Grabowski, a health care policy professor at Harvard Medical School, told The Atlantic in April 2020. \"We don\u2019t value their lives as much as other people\u2019s.\" Many families complained to local media that they weren't notified about COVID-positive cases in nursing homes and never got to say their goodbyes. Walz's administration discouraged families from taking their loved ones out of nursing homes and bringing them home for visits. \"MDH strongly recommends against families bringing residents of long-term care facilities to their homes during this time. This recommendation applies whether residents have previously been diagnosed with COVID-19 or have recently tested negative for COVID-19,\" the Minnesota Department of Health's executive order 20-99 said. In 2020, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed New York nursing homes to accept patients believed to have COVID-19 \u2014 a decision that subjected his administration to fierce criticism.

Andrew Cuomo directed New York nursing homes to accept patients believed to have COVID-19 \u2014 a decision that subjected his administration to fierce criticism. Cuomo's policy did not allow nursing homes to inquire about a patient's COVID status when making their decision to accept patients. Hannah Grossman is a Reporter at Fox News Digital.

Chris Sununu discusses President Biden\u2019s upcoming Oval Office address as Vice President Kamala Harris hits the campaign trail on \u2018Your World.\u2019 GovTrack, an organization that tracks congressional voting records, confirmed to Fox News Digital it had removed a 2019 web page that ranked Kamala Harris as that year's \"most liberal\" U.S. senator sometime within the last two weeks. The self-described \"government transparency website\" scored Harris as the \"most liberal compared to all senators\" in 2019, outranking Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren at the time. But the web page with the ranking, which was widely covered in news reports during the 2020 election, was recently deactivated. The link now displays a \"Page Not Found\" message. The Internet Archive shows the page was deleted sometime between July 10 and July 23, with some on X claiming the page was still up on July 22. President Biden announced his decision to suspend his campaign and endorse Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee on July 21. Harris announced in the early hours of July 23 that she had secured enough delegates to lock up the nomination at the DNC next month. MONTAGE: LIBERAL MEDIA TRIES TO DOWNPLAY KAMALA HARRIS' BORDER RESPONSIBILITIES Vice President Kamala Harris was once ranked the \u2018most liberal\u2019 U.S. senator. (REUTERS/Kevin Mohatt/Pool) When reached by Fox News Digital, GovTrack founder Joshua Tauberer said the page was removed because the company adopted a policy \"several years ago\" to end its single-year ratings of lawmakers to only do ratings based on Congressional sessions, which are two years. \"We determined that the limited data available in a single year was not sufficient to create a reliable portrait of the activity of legislators, particularly given the ebbs and flows of the legislative calendar, and therefore did not serve as a useful tool to our users and the American public,\" Tauberer said. \"We subsequently took down the previously-published single-calendar-year statistics for the same reason.\" Tauberer confirmed to Fox News Digital that the page was removed sometime in the last two weeks, but did not give a specific date. Asked why the pages weren't removed when single-year report cards were abandoned years ago, he said, \"I was focused on more impactful aspects of our work.\" Tauberer said the organization was still publishing report cards based on two-year congressional sessions and pointed Fox News Digital to Harris' existing 2020 web page, which ranked her ideology as the \"most politically left compared to Senate Democrats\" for the 116th Congress. She was ranked the second most liberal in all the Senate behind Independent Sanders. At some point in October 2020, GovTrack changed its ranking language from \"most liberal\" to \"most politically left.\" The group's\u00a0analysis is based on senators\u2019 \"legislative behavior\" and their record of sponsoring or cosponsoring bipartisan bills, which it says \"only takes into account a small aspect of reality.\" The analysis in 2019 showed that Harris joined bipartisan legislation \"the least often compared to Senate Democrats.\" U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris attends an infrastructure event addressing high speed internet in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building's South Court Auditorium at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 3, 2021.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein) AXIOS HIT WITH COMMUNITY NOTE AFTER CLAIMING HARRIS WAS \u2018NEVER BORDER CZAR\u2019 The Trump campaign cited the rating after Biden announced Harris as his running mate in 2020, pushing back on a New York Times feature that described Harris as a \"pragmatic moderate.\" \"Reminder: GovTrack ranked Senator Kamala Harris the most liberal member of the U.S. Senate in 2019, farther left than Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey, and even Bernie Sanders,\" the campaign sent in an August 2020 email. \"Kamala Harris is a radical left-wing liberal, despite what the New York Times may say.\" Harris' 2019 rating came back under scrutiny this week after Biden endorsed Harris as his successor on Sunday, releasing a bombshell letter informing the American public that he was answering the mounting calls to suspend his re-election campaign. Harris confirmed that she would run for the Democratic nomination, writing in a statement, \"I am honored to have the President\u2019s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\" President Biden endorced Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor for the November election. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) As Harris heads toward the Democratic nomination, her allies in the media are now suggesting it's unfair to pin the thorny issue of illegal immigration on her. Axios was particularly roasted Wednesday over a piece insisting Harris wasn\u2019t the \"border czar\" that seemed to contradict its own previous reporting. The outlet was even forced to update the story by admitting it had \"incorrectly\" called her a \"border czar\" in the past. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Harris has received endorsements from former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as several Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y, and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum discusses the FBIs investigation into former President Trumps would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks on America Reports. Forbes deleted an article Sunday titled, \"Will Surviving Gunfire Be Donald Trump\u2019s Next Appeal To Black Voters?\" The article, written by Forbes contributor and \"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) expert\" Shaun Harper, was published a few hours after a shooter attempted to assassinate former President Trump during a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. In the article, Harper floated the idea that Trump may use surviving the shooting as a new way to connect to Black voters. SKY NEWS EDITS HEADLINE AFTER TAKING HEAT FOR \u2018BLAMING\u2019 TRUMP FOR ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT Republican candidate Donald Trump is seen with blood on his face surrounded by Secret Service agents as he is taken off the stage at a campaign event at Butler Farm Show Inc. in Butler, Pennsylvania, July 13, 2024.\u00a0 (Rebecca Droke/AFP via Getty Images) \"\u2019And the Blacks, they love me because they know the terrifying sound of gunshots,\u2019 isn\u2019t a claim that Trump has \u2018actually\u2019 made. Hopefully, he doesn\u2019t. But it isn\u2019t all that unthinkable,\" Harper wrote in the article that was captured by the Wayback Machine. He pointed to Trump\u2019s comments from a South Carolina rally last August where he suggested that Black voters \"embraced\" his mugshot that was taken in Fulton County jail in Georgia. \"The mug shot, we\u2019ve all seen the mug shot, and you know who embraced it more than anybody else? The Black population. It\u2019s incredible. You see Black people walking around with my mug shot, you know they do shirts,\" Trump said. A deleted Forbes article claimed that Trump might use his raised fist after being shot to appeal to Black voters. (Photo by Ira L. Black/Corbis via Getty Images | \u00a0Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Harper also added Trump could claim pumping his fist in the air after being struck by a bullet was a homage to the \"Black Power Salute\" seen in the well-known 1968 Olympics photo as well as the 2020 George Floyd marches. \"Let\u2019s hope not. That would be revisionist history,\" Harper wrote. \"Another racially problematic kinship narrative is unlikely to make Black voters see Trump as one of them. And it most certainly won\u2019t fix the gun violence crisis in rural, suburban, or urban places in which too many Americans are unnecessarily placed at risk of being shot.\" Another capture of the article from Sunday deleted many of these paragraphs but kept the suggestion Trump could still use the shooting as a campaign strategy.

Sky News, a Comcast-owned British media organization, was criticized on social media for \"blaming the victim\" in the aftermath of Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt on former President Trump. The FBI identified Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man from western Pennsylvania, as the person who attempted to assassinate Trump at a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crooks reportedly shot Trump from a rooftop perch some 130 yards away, striking the upper part of Trump\u2019s right ear. Trump survived and has been released from the hospital. Sky News posted a story initially headlined, \"Nothing justified an assassination bid \u2013 but did Trump play a part in changing the rules of engagement?\" EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS POUR IN FOLLOWING TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT IN PENNSYLVANIA: \u2018JUST BLOOD EVERYWHERE\u2019 Sky News changed its headline after widespread backlash. The headline was quickly criticized on social media, with many accusing the news organization of victim blaming. Musician Winston Marshall posted on X that Sky News is \"the winner for the most disgraceful, disgusting MSM headline\" in the wake of the assassination attempt on Trump. \"Straight to blaming the victim,\" Marshall wrote. Sky News eventually changed the headline to \"US politics is laced with malevolence and division - it needs a reset,\" but the original headline remained in the story\u2019s URL. The initial headline, which was captured by social media users, was confirmed to be authentic by Fox News Digital via the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Sky News correspondent James Matthews wrote in the story that in the aftermath of the assassination attempt \"there were reminders from Trump opponents about how, in the past, he had joked about the brutal assault on the husband of former Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\" \"Likewise, his downplaying of a kidnap plot against Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer wasn't forgotten. No one's claiming that anything justified an assassination attempt but the clear suggestion is that Donald Trump played his part in changing the rules of engagement and recklessly drove hostility in US politics,\" Matthews wrote. Comcast, which owns NBC and MSNBC in the United States, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sky News did not immediately respond to a series of questions, including whether the headline was changed because of backlash. Fox News Digital\u2019s Scott McDonald contributed to this report.

Kim Reynolds explains on 'Fox & Friends' that the Biden administration claimed her state's new law is interfering with federal immigration enforcement. A Democrat running in a competitive Iowa district scrubbed his X account of dozens of anti-Trump and pro-Biden posts prior to winning the congressional primary earlier this month, according to archival website information found by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC). Combat veteran and former USDA official Lanon Baccam won Iowa's Third Congressional District Democratic nomination on June 4 in a landslide over rival Melissa Vine. He now faces Republican Zach Nunn in November. A veteran of Democratic political campaigns, Baccam previously served as President Biden's Iowa deputy state director in addition to earlier work on the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and for Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and other Democratic campaigns and causes.

Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz and Israeli activist Noa Tishby join Hannity to discuss Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) director saying he was happy to witness Oct. 7 attacks. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) appears to have scrubbed Democratic lawmakers' praise for its group from its website following blowback over its leader's controversial statements regarding Hamas, Fox News Digital has discovered. Nihad Awad, CAIR's executive director, recently said he was \"happy to see\" the Oct. 7 Hamas invasion of Israel and that the Jewish state did not have a right to self-defense because it was an \"occupying power.\" After Awad made the contentious comments, Fox News Digital and other publications\u00a0questioned Democratic lawmakers\u00a0who previously expressed support for the group in letters and statements, including some posted on CAIR's endorsements and awards page.

Police interview pro-Palestinian protester Loay Alnaji on Nov. 5 in the moments after he and Paul Kessler got into an altercation that led Kessler to strike his head on concrete, sustaining blunt force trauma that would later kill him. (VC News) CNN changed a headline on Thursday following outrage over their report about an arrest being made for the death of a Jewish man at a protest in Los Angeles earlier this month. The Ventura County Sheriff's Department announced that Loay Abdelfattah Alnaji, 50, had been taken into custody and charged with involuntary manslaughter related to the death of Paul Kessler on Nov. 5. Investigators with the department allege that Alnaji caused Kessler, a 69-year-old pro-Israel protester, to knock his head onto the concrete when he fell, which resulted in brain hemorrhaging that led to his death hours later in the hospital. Some witnesses have told Fox News Digital that the pro-Palestinian protester struck Kessler with his megaphone. According to the Wayback Machine, CNN\u2019s original headline read, \"Arrest made in death of Jewish protester who fell and hit his head.\" However, hours later, it changed. \"Arrest made in death of Jewish protester in California after confrontation over Israel-Hamas war,\" the new headline reads. CNN changed its headlines on Loay Abdelfattah Alnaji's arrest for Paul Kessler's death on Thursday. (CNN) NBC NEWS CHANGES HEADLINE AFTER OMITTING MAN KILLED AT PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTEST WAS JEWISH The update followed intense online backlash from people accusing the news organization of bias. \"If all he did was fall and hit his head, why is anyone being arrested? Is the state of critical thinking today such that no one is expected to analyze nonsense headlines like this?\" BitChute senior policy officer Amy Peikoff asked. \"There's no fixing this. Either journalists are doing it on purpose or they're too far gone to know the difference. Either way,\" Sen. Ted Cruz's national security advisor Omri Ceren wrote. National Review contributor Pradheep Shanker agreed, \"The bias is real.\" \"They are also not saying that the suspect is a California college \u2018professor.\u2019 There's no fixing universities either,\" Daily Signal contributor Mike Gonzalez wrote, noting he's a computer science professor at Ventura County Community College.

An article from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) appeared to removed an accused pedophile\u2019s experience as a drag queen and Pride event planner after reporting on his arrest on Thursday. The BBC article originally had the title \"Ex-drag queen caught in paedophile [sic] hunters' sting operation\" and reported that 61-year-old Andrew Way was caught by pedophile hunters after impersonating a 27-year-old and sending sexual messages to the fake profile of a 14-year-old boy. \"A former drag queen was caught in an online sting by vigilante paedophile [sic] hunters, a court has heard,\" the article originally read. The BBC altered a headline to remove a reference to a pedophiles drag queen background.

The article contained an editor\u2019s note regarding the changes. \"An earlier version of this story made reference to details not reported in court and has been updated accordingly,\" the editor\u2019s note read. The BBC claimed that the article was changed after it \"made reference to details not reported in court.\" (Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images) A since-deleted tweet about the article from the BBC previously referenced Way as a drag queen. \"Ex-drag queen caught in paedophile [sic] hunters' sting operation,\" it read.

After being caught sending messages, Way pleaded guilty to sexual communications with a child as well as breaching his existing sexual harm prevention order later in court. He was sentenced to 34 months in jail by Judge Niclas Parry who denounced Way for showing \"utter disregard\" for his order. \"These were serious and persistent and different breaches,\" Parry said.

A federal judge has approved a permanent injunction against the online Internet Archive from scanning and sharing all copyrighted books already made available by publishers. Judge John Koeltl had already ruled in March that the Archive had illegally offered free e-editions of 127 books in copyright, including works by J.D. Salinger and Toni Morrison. Four leading publishers \u2014 Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, John Wiley & Sons and Penguin Random House \u2014 had sued the Archive in 2020 in response to its establishing a \"National Emergency Library\" early in the pandemic, when most libraries and bookstores were shutdown. The Archive had contended that it was protected by fair use and that it had a larger mission to make information as widely accessible as possible. The injunction was part of an agreement filed last week by the two sides in the lawsuit. Koeltl, of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, did agree with the Archive on one issue that remained in dispute: The publishers had wanted the injunction to cover e-books even if the publisher itself had not released one, while the Archive wanted the injunction to apply only when an e-book was available. All 127 books cited by the publishers had e-editions. BOOK BANNING EFFORTS ARE ON A RECORD-HIGH TRAJECTORY FOR 2022: REPORT \"The Court has narrowly tailored the injunctive relief in this case to cover only copyrighted works, like the Works in Suit, that are available from the Publishers in electronic form,\" Koeltl wrote. Maria Pallante, president and CEO of the trade group the Association of American Publishers, said in a statement Tuesday that the AAP was \"extremely pleased that the district court has approved the proposed consent judgment.\" She added that the scope of the injunction would have a \"very minimal impact.\" A federal judge has granted a permanent injunction against an internet archive for scanning and sharing copyrighted books. \"The overwhelming majority of the tens of thousands of books that plaintiffs make available in print are also commercially available from them as authorized ebooks,\" she said. \"Nor are the plaintiffs precluded from enforcing under the Copyright Act the small percentage of works that may not be covered by the injunction.\" The Internet Archive has said it plans to appeal the decision from March. Asked for comment Tuesday by The Associated Press, an Archive spokesperson referred to a blog posting last week by founder Brewster Kahle. \"Libraries are under attack at unprecedented scale today, from book bans to defunding to overzealous lawsuits like the one brought against our library,\" Kahle wrote. \"These efforts are cutting off the public\u2019s access to truth at a key time in our democracy. We must have strong libraries, which is why we are appealing this decision.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Archive, which features links to a vast range of print, audio and visual materials, also faces legal action from the music industry. Last week, Sony Music Entertainment and five other companies sued the Archive for digitizing 78 rpm records by Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday and thousands of others that the plaintiffs say remain in copyright. The recordings are part of the Archive's \"Great 78 \" project. \"When people want to listen to music they go to Spotify,\" Kahle wrote in response. \"When people want to study sound recordings as they were originally created, they go to libraries like the Internet Archive.

Former transgender kid, Chloe Cole, shares the complications she deals with every day as a result of medical interventions she was subjected to after being diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \"I'm not sure whether it'll even go away,\" she said. Boston Children's Hospital co-director at its Center for Gender Surgery called for a drastic increase in capacity for what he called \"gender-affirming care\" (GAC), including surgeries, for kids as GOP states enact bans on the practices. Oren Ganor is a plastic and reconstructive surgeon who specializes in gender-affirming surgeries. He has previously stated in an email that the hospital is \"slightly flexible\" when it comes to the age of transgender girls seeking genital surgery,\" according to a local outlet. The policy had not been finalized, he said, \"because of the issue around consent for sterilization.\" The children's hospital clarified to Fox News Digital that it does not provide genital surgeries on kids. A patient needs to live in their new gender for 12 months before the genital surgeries are considered. In a March 14 article he co-wrote with a medical school student, Shawheen J. Rezei, in The Journal of the American Medical Association, he said that the capacity for gender surgeries for kids needed to be increased.

They outlined several steps \"to improve capacity for this patient population\" since \"there will be an increased flux of patients traveling to seek care in states with more open legislation.\" The authors recommended medical school residency programs expose future physicians to GAC by \"increase training efforts\" for \"gender-affirming surgeries.\" \"[P]lastic surgery residencies currently do not have a recommended number of gender-affirming surgery cases that plastic surgery trainees see during training,\" the authors wrote.

The Boston Children's Hospital director called for an increase in capacity of gender-affirming care.\u00a0 (iStock) \"It is\u00a0important to recognize that for many gender-diverse young people, the decision to engage in gender-affirming care can be lifesaving and life-changing. Without this care, gender-diverse youth can experience severe distress, anxiety, and depression,\" the Children's hospital told Fox News Digital. \"[A]ny decisions about gender-affirming care should be made after a rigorous evaluation process that involves\u00a0a psychologist or social worker, a patient's doctor and their parents or guardians.\" FORMER TRANS KID SHARES AGONY OF SIDE EFFECTS FROM 'MUTILATING' MEDICAL TRANSITION: 'I'VE GOTTEN NO HELP' In August, Boston Children's Hospital posted a video, which was later deleted, where a psychologist explained that \u2018a good portion\u2019 of children she sees at the hospital's Gender MultiSpecialty Service (GeMS) clinic know their gender identity \u2018from the womb.\u2019\" Boston Children\u2019s Hospital also previously faced a wave of backlash over its Center for Gender Surgery that performs mastectomies on teenagers as young as 15, as well as since-deleted wording on the hospital's website that claimed teens as young as 17 can get vaginoplasties.

That wording has since been changed to read, \"To qualify for gender affirmation at Boston Children's Hospital, you must be at least 18 years old for\u00a0phalloplasty or\u00a0metoidioplasty and for\u00a0vaginoplasty.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A hospital spokesperson said \"for surgical consultation, you must be 17 years of age and between 18 and 35 years of age at the time of surgery.

James Comer, R-Ky., joined 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss the latest on the GOP-led probe into the Biden family's business dealings and his reaction to the potential arrest of former President Donald Trump. The office of then-Vice President Joe Biden tried to quash a Bloomberg News story about Hunter Biden at the younger Biden's firm's request, according to 2015 emails published Wednesday. Emails obtained by\u00a0America First Legal (AFL) through its ongoing lawsuit against the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), showed a close relationship between the vice president's office, Hunter Biden's longtime business partner and the media. On Dec. 8, 2015, The New York Times ran an article saying the \"credibility of the vice president\u2019s anticorruption message may have been undermined\" by Hunter\u2019s serving on the board of Burisma Holdings with its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. Later that day, Eric Schwerin, who was president of Hunter\u2019s now-defunct investment firm Rosemont Seneca Partners at the time, asked the vice president\u2019s then-communications director, Kate Bedingfield, whether there was any \"follow up\" by other news outlets on the Times article.

Schwerin and Bedingfield\u00a0expressed frustration after the story was published. \"Guess the Bloomberg reporter didn\u2019t have the ability to convince her editors not to make her write the story,\" Schwerin wrote to Bedingfield on Dec. 9, 2015. \"Really frustrating,\" Bedingfield replied. \"That said, so long as it doesn't elevate and trigger someone else to write, it's actually a good and straightforward response.

Editor's note: The following essay was first published in City Journal. The University of South Florida has adopted a radical \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) program that claims America is a force for \"white supremacy,\" encourages students to attend racially segregated counseling programs to address their \"privilege\" and \"oppression,\" and promotes a variety of left-wing causes, including \"reparations,\" \"defund the police,\" and \"prison abolition.\" I have obtained a\u00a0trove of public documents exposing the university\u2019s DEI programming, much of which, according to the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, the university tried to delete from its website following Florida governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s recent request for information on DEI in the state\u2019s public universities. Taken together, these materials paint a troubling picture. USF\u2019s sprawling diversity bureaucracy has turned left-wing racialism into a new orthodoxy and implemented an administrative policy of racial preferences and discrimination. It divides individuals into categories of oppressor and oppressed, presents \"anti-racism\" as the solution, and proposes \"racial identity development\"\u2014which, in practice, resembles a form of cult programming\u2014as the necessary method of atonement. FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN SEIZED BY THE DEI BUREAUCRACY The first step in this programming is the condemnation of American society. Following the 2020 death of George Floyd, nearly every appendage of USF condemned the United States as fundamentally racist. Then-president Steven Currall published a statement denouncing the \"systemic racism that continues to plague our nation.\" The English department attacked the United States for \"centuries of normalized violence, structural oppression, and dehumanizing rhetorics that target Black, Brown, and Indigenous people.\" The School of Interdisciplinary Global Studies blasted America for its \"institutionalized, structural racism and white supremacy.\" The anthropology department assailed its own discipline for being \"rooted in racism.\" The department of sociology pronounced on the \"interlocking systems of oppression found throughout the institutions of our country.\" Literacy studies, women\u2019s and gender studies, engineering, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, public health, and other departments released similar statements. Then the university\u2019s DEI administrators offered the solution: racial reeducation. In the aftermath of the ensuing George Floyd riots, the USF Counseling Center offered racially segregated counseling sessions for \"Black & African American,\" \"People of Color,\" and \"White\" students, providing a \"healing space for POC to discuss unique impacts of systemic racism\" and a \"connecting space for allies to share experiences and identify ways to take action against racism.\" DEI AGENDA IS ABOUT SATISFYING 'THE MOB,' SAYS FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY The goal of these psychological conditioning sessions, according to organizers, was to address \"COVID-19, xenophobia, killings of unarmed Black people, systemic racism, privilege, oppression, and institutional challenges.\" In this kind of programming, individuals are subordinated to racial categories; ideology serves as a substitute for psychological health. The endpoint of USF\u2019s DEI programming is left-wing political activism. As part of the university\u2019s official \u2018anti-racist\u2019 guidebook, diversity officials included materials promoting \u2018reparations,\u2019 \u2018defund the police,\u2019 and \u2018prison abolition.\u2019 Meantime, the university\u2019s DEI officers reinforced the narrative and offered a battery of resources for racial reconditioning. The Office of Multicultural Affairs published an official guidebook, \"Anti-Racist Resources: The Unlearning of Racism and White Supremacy,\" that promoted psychological approaches to \"white identity development.\" The premise of these programs is simple: whites suffer from \"white privilege,\" \"white guilt,\" and \"white fragility.\" And the solution is clear: whites must atone for their oppression through the process of \"racial identity development\" and \"becoming an active anti-racist.\" According to one of these programs, called \"Scaffolding Anti-Racist Resources,\" whites must first admit their complicity in racism, which includes \"being confronted with active racism of real-world experiences that highlight their whiteness.\" Whites will then enter the process of \"disintegration,\" experiencing \"white guilt\" and thinking, \"I feel bad for being white.\" Next, after their racial identity is broken down, they will enter a phase of \"reintegration,\" thinking, \"it\u2019s not my fault I\u2019m white\" and beginning to engage in left-wing political activism. OVERTURN OF CORPORATE DIVERSITY QUOTAS LAWS UPHELD IN CALIFORNIA APPEALS COURT Finally, as whites move through the stages of \"pseudo-independence\" and \"immersion,\" they will begin to \"work against systems of oppression\" and \"use [their] privilege to support anti-racist work.\" At the end of the program, their psychology should conform entirely to political ideology. As the final step, whites must answer various loyalty tests. \"Does your solidarity last longer than a news cycle?\" the training asks. \"Does your solidarity make you lose sleep at night? Does your solidarity put you in danger? Does your solidarity cost you relationships?\" The endpoint of USF\u2019s DEI programming is left-wing political activism. As part of the university\u2019s official \"anti-racist\" guidebook, diversity officials included materials promoting \"reparations,\" \"defund the police,\" and \"prison abolition.\" One resource, \"97 Things White People Can Do for Racial Justice,\" instructs whites to \"join a local \u2018white space,\u2019\" \"donate to [their] local BLM chapter,\" \"participate in reparations,\" and \"decolonize [their] bookshelf.\" Another, \"For Our White Friends Desiring to Be Allies,\" demands that whites \"stop talking about colorblindness\" and stop oppressing those \"who do not believe in a white, capitalist Jesus.\" Taken as a whole, USF\u2019s DEI initiatives resemble practices of cult initiation. The path of \"racial identity development\" does not take as its endpoint individual psychological health but the submersion of the individual into political ideology. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Whites are designated an oppressor class, born with racial guilt that can only be expiated through elaborate rituals and commitments to left-wing activism, to the point that they are alienated from previous relationships and feel compelled to \"change the way [they] vote,\" \"denounce [President Trump],\" and \"change how [they] read [their] Bible.\" At a more practical level, the implementation of DEI ideology at USF has already resulted in a system of widespread racial preferences and discrimination. The university openly promotes racial quotas in hiring and requires potential faculty to submit \"diversity statements\"\u2014best understood as loyalty oaths to left-wing racialism\u2014to be considered for employment. The university\u2019s Office of Supplier Diversity administers a system of racial and sexual preferences in contracting, instructing its \"Diversity Champions\" to hire vendors and suppliers based on identity, rather than on purely economic concerns. The university also promotes a range of racially segregated scholarships that explicitly exclude white students\u2014the only racial group that receives such treatment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP These \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" programs are a farce. In practice, they promote ideological conformity, racial and sexual discrimination, and the exclusion of any group that finds itself on the wrong side of the identity hierarchy. Gov. DeSantis, who recently pledged to defund DEI programs in Florida\u2019s public universities, should not hesitate in demolishing these offices, terminating the employment of their commissars, and restoring colorblind equality, individual merit, and scholarly excellence as the guiding principles of the academy.

FIRST ON FOX: House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark appears to have scrubbed an anti-police article from her official website ahead of taking the number two position in the lower chamber for House Democrats. Fox News Digital has learned that Clark, the second most powerful Democrat in the House, appears to have taken down a link to a Boston Globe article supporting the radical ideology from June 2020 before she took the House minority whip spot. The article, titled, \"Defund the police makes some Democrats uncomfortable. That\u2019s the point, activists say,\" was posted on Clark's official website under her \"In the News\" section where it remained from June 2020 before disappearing sometime after December 9, 2022.

In the article, Clark defended the Democrats' 2020 police reform bill that did not defund law enforcement, the Justice in Policing Act, as \"a beginning, not an end\" and that it is worth exploring \"how we allocate our resources to move police from being a culture of being warriors to being guardians.\" Internet Archive screenshot of Rep.

Bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota Bishop Robert Barron discusses the life and legacy of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVl on 'Fox News Live.' Politico appears to have terminated a reporter after he trashed Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI following his passing. On Dec. 31, Pope Benedict died at the age of 95 following a battle with an illness. Following the news of his death, Politico's cybersecurity reporter Eric Geller made clear he was not shedding a tear for the late Catholic leader. \"Homophobic pedophile protector and Hitler Youth alumnus dead at 95,\" Geller tweeted. Geller faced intense backlash by critics for the hostile tweet, which he later walked back and took down. \"I deleted the tweet about Pope Benedict that was offensive and in poor judgment,\" Geller wrote. \u2018OH, FOR CHRIST\u2019S SAKE': CNN HOT MIC CATCHES AUDIBLE GROAN DURING KEVIN MCCARTHY REMARKS Pope Benedict XVI helds the weekly general audience in St. Peter's square at the Vatican, April 21, 2010.\u00a0 (Eric Vandeville/ABACAPRESS.COM) Brad Dayspring, Politico's vice president of marketing and communications, called Geller's tweet \"a clear violation of our social media policy and was both inaccurate and offensive.\" \"Violations of company policy\u2014including the social media policy\u2014are subject to an internal review process.

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has deleted criteria for a nutrition fellowship program, for which only applicants who were Black, indigenous or people of color were eligible, following a civil rights complaint. The Global Food Research Program webpage for the university, under the criteria section, initially said that students who wish to apply must be of \"Racial/ethnic background of Black, Indigenous or People of Color (BIPOC) that is historically marginalized in academia and the field of nutrition in the United States.\" \"Currently, the field of nutrition is overwhelmingly comprised of white researchers. Increased BIPOC representation in food policy research is critical for developing effective, equitable, comprehensive, and culturally competent policies that address nutrition-related health disparities,\" the application initially read, according to The Wayback Machine.

(Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images) People rally in support of affirmative action in college admissions at the Supreme Court, Oct 31, 2022, in Washington, D.C. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) On Dec. 19, Do No Harm senior fellow and University of Michigan Professor Mark Perry sent a federal civil rights complaint to the Washington, D.C., Office for Civil Rights for \"illegal discrimination on the basis of race, color, and/or national origin in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" \"In violation of Title VI, non-BIPOC students are illegally excluded from the FERN program, illegally denied the benefits of this program, and illegally discriminated against on the basis of their race, color and national origin,\" Perry wrote. The webpage has since scrubbed such criteria and is now open to undergraduate students with a second- or third-year academic standing and an expressed interest in food and nutrition, who are pursuing advanced degrees or credentials in public health and nutrition, in an update first spotted by The Daily Caller. UNC Chapel Hill's media relations manager Pace Sagester told Fox News Digital that the criteria did not reflect the school's commitment to inclusion. \"A webpage for the Fellowship for Exploring Research in Nutrition (FERN) provided eligibility criteria which did not accurately reflect Carolina\u2019s commitment to inclusion,\" Sagester said. \"The eligibility criteria on the webpage have been corrected. Carolina remains committed to an inclusive and equitable community for all. A diverse student body is vital to fostering academic excellence, helping to broaden understanding among people of all backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences, spurring innovation and preparing engaged citizens and future leaders.\" SUPREME COURT LIKELY TO BAN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS, LEGAL EXPERTS SAY Similar federal complaints have been filed in the past. In November, Perry filed a complaint against 12 Oklahoma colleges and claimed that the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program requires that applicants identify as African America, Hispanic, Native American, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. Last May, Parents Defending Education filed a complaint after Massachusetts\u2019 Wellesley Public Schools allegedly excluded White students from a healing space designated for other racial and ethnic groups. In late October, the Supreme Court began hearing arguments from Students for Fair Admissions against UNC Chapel Hill and Harvard University. The nonprofit made a similar argument to Perry, asserting that the schools violated the Civil Right Act by discriminating against applicants on the basis of their race. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The nonprofit further argued that Asian Americans suffer from the schools\u2019 practices and that White applicants are also harmed by the policies of UNC. The court is looking to see whether UNC acted properly by rejecting a \"race-neutral \"approach to admissions, and whether Harvard violated Title VI. Students for Fair Admissions sued both universities as part of separate cases. A decision is expected in 2023 and will determine the fate of affirmative action, including whether universities will be allowed to use race as a factor in admissions processes.

New York congressional candidate George Santos joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how he secured victory over his Democratic opponent and Kathy Hochul's projected victory over Lee Zeldin in the gubernatorial race. Rep.-elect George Santos, R-N.Y., has responded to a New York Times report that questioned parts of his biography, accusing the paper of launching a \"shotgun blast of attacks\" before he is sworn into the new Congress. The history-making political newcomer, an openly gay Republican and son of Brazilian immigrants, has faced questions about his authenticity after details of his biography could not be confirmed by multiple news outlets. Santos, who flipped New York's 3rd Congressional District into the GOP column in November, has called allegations that he lied to voters about his biography a \"smear\" and \"defamatory.\" \"George Santos represents the kind of progress than the Left is so threatened by \u2013 a gay, Latino, first generation American and Republican who won a Biden district in overwhelming fashion by showing everyday voters that there is a better option than the broken promises and failed policies of the Democratic Party. After four years in the public eye, and on the verge of being sworn in as a member of the Republican led 118th Congress, the New York Times launches this shotgun blast of attacks,\" Santos said through his attorney, Joseph Murray. \"It is no surprise that Congressman-elect Santos has enemies at the New York Times who are attempting to smear his good name with these defamatory allegations. As Winston Churchill famously stated, \u2018You have enemies? Good. It means that you\u2019ve stood up for something, sometime in you life,'\" Murray said. That quote, while often attributed to Winston Churchill, actually originated with Victor Hugo in his 1845 essay, Villemain. There is no evidence of Churchill ever saying it.

Citigroup managing director Danielle Romero-Apsilos told Fox News, \"I am unable to confirm Mr. Santos\u2019 employment with Citi.\" Santos had also told voters he ran an animal rescue nonprofit called Friends of Pets United for the past five years.

The Washington Post claimed the Libs of TikTok Twitter account published \"erroneous information\" that \"falsely suggested\" Washington D.C.\u2019s Children\u2019s National Hospital performed hysterectomies in a Friday report, despite the hospital previously claiming otherwise on its website. Staff writer Peter Jamison reported that Children\u2019s National Hospital faced scrutiny and threats after Libs of TikTok publicized allegations that the hospital performed \"gender-affirming\" surgeries on minors based on recordings with employees. \"Children\u2019s National Hospital has been inundated with threatening emails and phone calls after an influential right-wing Twitter account published a recording that falsely suggested the hospital is performing hysterectomies on transgender children, a hospital spokeswoman said. The torrent of harassment was accompanied by social media posts suggesting that Children\u2019s be bombed and its doctors placed in a woodchipper,\" Jamison wrote. He noted that \"Children\u2019s has not disputed the authenticity of the recording,\" instead they claim that \"the employees provided inaccurate information.\" An archived webpage from Aug. 18 on Children's National Hospital's website listed \"gender-affirming medical care and gender-affirming hysterectomy\" among the services offered for \"patients between\u00a0the ages of 0-21\" through the hospital's gynecology program. (Screenshot/Internet Archive) WASHINGTON POST CHEERS WHITE HOUSE TWITTER ACCOUNT\u2019S \u2018FEISTY\u2019, \u2018PERSONAL\u2019 ATTACKS ON GOP An archived screenshot of the website from Aug. 18 shows the hospital's gynecology program originally listed \"gender-affirming medical care and gender-affirming hysterectomy\" on patients aged 0-21 as one of its services. After Libs of TikTok\u2019s report on Thursday, the services offered have been changed. Jamison reported, \"Children\u2019s National officials admit that some information put out by the hospital has increased public confusion. Before Thursday, the hospital\u2019s website erroneously stated that gender-affirming hysterectomy was available to patients 'between the ages of 0-21, an error that has been corrected,\" according to a hospital spokeswoman. \"Such statements have not dispelled the furor Raichik\u2019s Thursday post unleashed,\"\u00a0wrote Jamison, without appearing to independently confirm the spokeswoman's claims. He also blasted media sites which he said \"ran stories based on the erroneous information provided in the telephone conversations\" from Libs of TikTok. Audio provided by the Libs of TikTok founder featured two hospital workers being asked via a phone conversation if a 16-year-old could receive a \"gender-affirming hysterectomy.\" Both said yes and one worker replied that she had \"seen younger kids\" than 16 have hysterectomies. The Libs of TikTok Twitter account was locked on Sunday with no clear explanation. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) A hospital spokesperson told Fox News Digital last week that the phone conversation \"reflects a call with hospital operators, not anyone who delivers care to our patients\" and the hospital has not provided any gender surgeries to children under 18. \"Children's National Hospital is committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all and to serving our LGBTQ+ patients and families in the full spectrum of their care,\" the spokesperson said. \"We do not provide gender-affirming surgery for anyone under the age of 18. We do not provide hormone therapy to children before puberty begins. Care is individualized for each patient and always involves families making decisions in coordination with a team of highly trained pediatric specialists.\" WAPO\u2019S MILBANK CHEERS BIDEN\u2019S \u2018SEMI-FASCISM\u2019 SMEAR OF MAGA-REPUBLICANS: \u2018TAKING US\u2019 TO \u2018AUTHORITARIANISM\u2019 Libs of TikTok referenced the Washington Post article shortly after its publication Friday, blasting the claim that the allegations were \"falsely suggested.\" \"\u2019Falsely suggested?\u2019 THEY ADMITTED IT MULTIPLE TIMES ON RECORD. WaPo thinks we're stupid,\" the account tweeted. In another thread, Lib of TikTok criticized Jamison for appearing to ignore her agreeing to an interview before publishing the article without her comments. \"Unreal. WaPo\u2019s @PeteJamison reached out for comment and I responded 12 minutes later agreeing to an interview. He then published it hours later without responding to me until after publication! Now he\u2019s saying he can update the story with my comments. That\u2019s not how this works!\" The account added, \"What an absolute hack @PeteJamison is. He even included in the story that I said I would do an interview but now he tells me he didn't see my message! You can't make this up!\" The article was later updated to say that The Post \"had missed that response and published the story before an interview could be arranged.\" Jamison did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital in time for publication. At the bottom of Jamison's piece, it was also noted that Taylor Lorenz contributed to the report. Lorenz previously doxxed the creator behind Libs of TikTok in April, publishing her name, occupation and the region where she lives. That report came just days after Lorenz decried the online harassment of women. Libs of TikTok shared a photo showing Washington Post journalist Taylor Lorenz allegedly at the doorstep of one of her relatives. (Libs of TikTok/Twitter) (Libs of TikTok/Twitter) On Sunday, Libs of TikTok was once again locked out on Twitter, which blocks its owner from sending tweets or signing in to the account. According to an email reportedly sent to the account\u2019s owner, Libs of TikTok violated the Twitter rules against \"hateful conduct,\" though it has not been made clear which post was found to be offensive. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The account was previously suspended in June after Libs of TikTok posted a lengthy thread warning about adults promoting children participating or viewing drag shows. Facebook also permanently suspended the account on Aug. 18 without citing any particular reason. Fox News' Adam Sabes contributed to this report.

Boston Children\u2019s Hospital is facing a wave of backlash over its Center for Gender Surgery that performs mastectomies on teenagers as young as 15, as well as since-deleted wording on the hospital's website that claimed teens as young as 17 can get vaginoplasties. The hospital\u2019s website stated as recently as Aug. 12 that \"to qualify for gender affirmation at Boston Children's Hospital, you must be at least 18 years old for phalloplasty or metoidioplasty and at least 17 years old for vaginoplasty,\" according to The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. That wording has since been changed to read, \"To qualify for gender affirmation at Boston Children's Hospital, you must be at least 18 years old for\u00a0phalloplasty or\u00a0metoidioplasty and for\u00a0vaginoplasty.\" A PDF about the eligibility requirements for a vaginoplasty that previously stated, \"You must be between 17 and 35 years of age at the time of surgery,\"\u00a0has also been removed from the \"Eligibility for Surgery\" webpage. PEDIATRICIAN GROUP SLAMS ITS OWN MEMBERS OVER TRANSGENDER TEEN PUBERTY BLOCKER CRITICISM: \u2018DISINFORMATION\u2019 The website for Boston Children's Hospital's Center for Gender Surgery stated as recently as Aug. 12 that \"to qualify for gender affirmation at Boston Children's Hospital, you must be at least 18 years old for phalloplasty or metoidioplasty and at least 17 years old for vaginoplasty.\"\u00a0 (Photo by Lane Turner/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) The hospital describes a vaginoplasty as a \"procedure in which surgeons create a vagina from your existing genital tissue.\" A hospital spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement that\u00a0\"for surgical consultation, you must be 17 years of age and between 18 and 35 years of age at the time of surgery. We have since updated this to reflect the protocols for the practice, which we have always\u00a0adhered to (no surgery under 18 years of age).\" The webpage previously made no mention of 17-year-olds only being eligible for \"surgical consultation\" before surgery. Currently, the webpage doesn\u2019t mention 17-year-olds at all. Boston Children\u2019s Hospital made the changes to its website after Libs of TikTok highlighted videos posted on YouTube by the hospital about \"gender-affirming\" hysterectomies. The hospital issued a public statement Tuesday responding to the backlash by slamming the spread of \"misinformation\" and a lack of \"respect\" for trans people, explaining that it does not perform \"gender-affirming\" hysterectomies on anyone under 18. \"We condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms, and we reject the false narrative upon which they are based,\" the hospital said. The hospital made no mention in its Tuesday statement about its own wording regarding vaginoplasties apparently being in conflict with its policy, which contributed to much of the backlash. Fox News Digital asked the hospital whether it was willing to acknowledge that its own website may have been responsible for some of the \"misinformation\" being spread, but it did not respond to that question. \"As we submitted in our statement yesterday afternoon for hysterectomies and other genital surgeries performed as part of gender-affirming care, Boston Children\u2019s requires a patient to be capable of consenting for themselves,\" the hospital said Wednesday. \"Age 18 is used to reflect the standard age of majority for medical decision-making. Boston Children\u2019s does not perform genital surgeries as part of gender-affirming care on a patient under the age of 18.\" Boston Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s website says it follows\u00a0the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) guidelines \"to surgically treat people who are stable in their gender identity and have documentation\u00a0of persistent gender dysphoria.\" According to the Associated Press, WPATH\u2019s forthcoming updated guidance will lower its\u00a0recommended minimum age for most genital surgeries to age 17, including womb and testicle removal, a year earlier than previous guidance, though that version has not yet been released.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) Another point of controversy at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital is that it performs mastectomies on children as young as 15 who identify as transgender. Those patients must provide a letter from a mental health provider stating they have the capacity to consent and a letter from a medical doctor or nurse practitioner saying they have \"persistent, well documented, gender dysphoria\" and specifying either the length of hormone therapy or why they are not taking hormone therapy. A study published in March that was approved by the institutional review board of Boston Children\u2019s Hospital said, \"The Center for Gender Surgery (CfGS) at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital (BCH) was the first pediatric center in the United States to offer gender-affirming chest surgeries for individuals over 15 years old and genital surgeries for those over 17 years of age.\" The study said that between January 2017 to August 2020, the CfGS performed 177 chest surgeries and that 36.7% of those surgeries were on patients younger than 18, with the youngest being 15. During that time period It also performed 27 genital surgeries, including 5 vaginoplasties. Boston Children's Hospital faced online furor for its description of gender-related surgeries offered to minors. \u00a0 ((Lane Turner/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)) Fox News Digital asked several follow-up questions of Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, including whether it has ever performed a vaginoplasty on someone younger than 18, how many 15-year-olds had received chest surgeries to date, how many 18-year-olds had received genital surgeries to date, and where the CfGS gets its funding, but it did not respond. Meanwhile, Libs of TikTok said Wednesday that Facebook had suspended its account over the posts about gender-related surgeries at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, and critics are accusing the account of launching a right-wing, anti-trans hate campaign that\u2019s putting hospital workers in danger.

The \u2018Libs of Tik Tok\u2019 creator reveals what platforms besides Twitter have punished her on \u2018Tucker Carlson Tonight.\u2019 Washington Post's \"internet culture\" columnist Taylor Lorenz sparked a media firestorm with her report revealing the identity of the popular Twitter personality Libs of TikTok, but her call of scrutinizing the powerful appears to only apply in one direction. Over the past year, Libs of TikTok has soared as one of the most recognizable Twitter accounts among conservatives for sharing public TikTok videos of individuals, many of them teachers, touting various woke ideologies like promoting the growing spectrums of sexual orientation and gender identity as well as critical race theory principles towards children, which has fueled the national debate over education. WAPO'S TAYLOR LORENZ SAYS IT'S \u2018PATENTLY FALSE\u2019 THAT HER LIBS OF TIKTOK STORY LINKED TO PERSONAL INFO Last Tuesday, Lorenz wrote a piece revealing Libs of TikTok's name, occupation, where in the country she lived, even her religion. Lorenz and the Post faced intense backlash, insisting nothing that was published was personal information, though the original story did include a link that allegedly exposed her address, which was later removed. Washington Post columnist Taylor Lorenz revealed Libs of TikTok's name, occupation, religion and where in the country she lived.\u00a0 (MSNBC) During an interview with CNN's Brian Stelter, Lorenz defended her story as being newsworthy and that Libs of TikTok should be publicly identified. \"This woman is shaping the media ecosystem and shaping legislation and public discourse around legislation. She's also talked about mobilizing her base to run for local school boards and is collecting email lists, which 100% are going to be used for political purposes. So this is a political force. This is an influential media force. The idea that this woman is not newsworthy is quite nonsense,\" Lorenz said, adding, \"we should scrutinize anyone that has power in this country, anyone that's influencing politics and legislation and public sentiment in the media.\" WASHINGTON POST'S TAYLOR LORENZ DOXXES LIBS OF TIKTOK DAYS AFTER DECRYING ONLINE HARASSMENT OF WOMEN Lorenz, on the other hand, goes to great lengths to keep scrutiny away from her, particularly when it comes to her tweets. For starters, Lorenz is famous for blocking her critics and journalists who report on her in an unflattering way. She also has her tweets automatically deleted after roughly a month on her Twitter page, although that's a common practice on the platform. But perhaps her most extreme effort to keep her old tweets hidden was her request for her Twitter page to be removed from the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. Last week, CNS News editor Rob Shimshock highlighted how the Wayback Machine, a digital archive of the internet, tells users searching for Lorenz's Twitter page, \"This URL has been excluded\" from the service. Search results in the Wayback Machine show Taylor Lorenz's Twitter page has been \"excluded\" from the internet archive upon request.\u00a0 (Internet Archive) On the Wayback Machine's user guide, it says content owners who want their sites excluded from the service \"can send an email request for us to review to info@archive.org with the URL (web address) in the text of your message.\" In a 2002 forum exchange with users, the Internet Archive elaborated on its policy, writing, \"While we collect publicly available Internet documents, sometimes authors and publishers express a desire for their documents not to be included in the Wayback Machine\u2026 If the author or publisher of some part of the Archive does not want his or her work in the Wayback Machine, then we may remove that portion from Wayback Machine without notice.\" It is unclear how long ago Lorenz made her request for her Twitter page to be excluded from the Wayback Machine, which can be years before she wrote her Libs of TikTok story. Her Instagram and Facebook pages as well as her professional website remain on the service, according to search results. TAYLOR LORENZ SAYS SHE REGRETS \u2018ERROR\u2019 OF CLAIMING ENTREPRENEUR USED \u2018R-SLUR\u2019 Fox News reached out to Lorenz with inquiries about her request to exclude her Twitter page from the Wayback Machine including her response to critics who say her calls to \"scrutinize\" influential figures in politics and media while hiding her own Twitter history is hypocritical. Lorenz did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. Additionally, Fox News reached out to the Internet Archive about its process of honoring requests to scrub content from the Wayback Machine and whether it ever declines requests. The Internet Archive pointed to previous public statements about its policies but declined to comment further. Lorenz has repeatedly insisted her story did not include any personal information about Libs of TikTok, She told Stelter it is \"patently false\" to claim her story included a link doing so despite The Washington Post admitting it scrubbed a link that allegedly exposed a home address (A spokesperson for The Washington Post previously told Fox News its report \"linked to publicly available professional information\" and when asked why the link was scrubbed, The Post replied, \"Ultimately, we deemed it unnecessary.\"). Fox News asked Lorenz why was it essential to include, among other details, Libs of TikTok's religion and how is it relevant to the story. Lorenz did not respond. Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz has been confronted with accusations of hypocrisy as her story doxxing Libs of TikTok came just weeks after she sat down with MSNBC about online harassment she has experienced, sharing violent threats she had received and claiming she suffers from \"severe PTSD\" and had contemplated suicide.\u00a0 (\u00a0(Photo by Eric BARADAT / AFP) (Photo by ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images) | CNBC Television/YouTube/Screenshot) Lorenz accused her critics of \"spinning these outrage cycles,\" insisting they're part of an \"operation\" of the \"right-wing media machine.\" \"The whole goal with the right-wing media is to obscure this stuff and attack journalism and to try and discredit any kind of journalist that attempts to hold these powers to account\u2026 I assumed that they would have drama, sort of like what they do,\" Lorenz told Stelter, later adding, \"The right will make those arguments because they don't want scrutiny.\" Fox News asked Lorenz if she does not believe any of her critics act in good faith and if any criticism of her work is legitimate. Lorenz did not respond. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Lorenz was also confronted with accusations of hypocrisy as her story doxxing Libs of TikTok came just days after she sat down with MSNBC about online harassment she has experienced.

WASHINGTON POST'S TAYLOR LORENZ DOXXES LIBS OF TIKTOK DAYS AFTER DECRYING ONLINE HARASSMENT OF WOMEN It is unclear whether Lorenz requested her tweets to be removed from the site and she did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News. According to the Media Research Center, Lorenz had shared more than 16,800 tweets as of November 10, 2020 but only 3,500 currently appear on her Twitter page. Lorenz, who left The New York Times for the Washington Post this year, found herself back in the news this week when she revealed the identity of the previously anonymous woman behind the Libs of TikTok Twitter account, only a few weeks after crying on MSNBC because of online harassment she had faced herself. Lorenz revealed her name, occupation, religion and where in the country she lived. The article even included a hyperlink that exposed personal information such as her work address \u2013 but the Post later removed the link after being called out by critics. Lorenz rejected accusations that she had \"doxxed\" the LibsofTikTok creator in an interview with CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter. \"We absolutely did not reveal any personal information about this woman at all, remotely,\" Lorenz said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter. \"And, you know, I know that sometimes reporting practices can seem foreign to people that aren't familiar with journalism, but this was very by the book and very benign\u2026 We didn't reveal anything personal and certainly, you know, not directing any kind of hate towards her.\" Taylor Lorenz appeared to refer to the United States as a \"trash country.\"\u00a0 (Photo by Jerod Harris/Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Washington Post previously released a statement defending Lorenz similarly, asserting, \"We do not publish or link to any details about her personal life,\" which sparked allegations that the paper lied, including by Libs of TikTok.

The campaign website for California House GOP candidate Greg Raths, who's running against Rep. Young Kim in a primary, appears to copy nearly word-for-word several passages from South Carolina Sen.

A smaller, smarter, more efficient government. Those are the values and priorities Lindsey Graham has fought for as a senator in Washington,\" Graham's website said in 2020. Raths told Fox News Friday that he was unaware of the issue until it was brought to his attention by a reporter. \"I work with several staffers who give me inputs to my webpage content and some of that data may have come from another conservative candidate's website.\u00a0Although I agree with Senator Graham on several issues, it was never my intent\u00a0to use his verbiage\u00a0on my site,\" Raths said. \"This does give me the feeling that my opponents\u00a0are digging deep into my campaign for anything to slow my strong surge in the final weeks of this primary campaign for CA40th Congressional District.\" (Greg Raths for Congress campaign) Raths ran for Congress in California's 45th district in 2020 and lost a relatively close race against progressive Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif. He filed paperwork to run against the freshman Kim, R-Calif., in the state's 40th Congressional District late last year. But Raths' campaign website this time around appears to include several passages that appeared in nearly identical form on the website for Graham, R-S.C., when he ran for reelection last cycle.

The New York Times had to issue a correction Monday to a left-wing columnist's piece that broadly mischaracterized Florida legislation about race-based trainings in schools and businesses. Writing about the Stop WOKE Act that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to sign, Charles Blow claimed the \"so-called anti-critical-race-theory law\" \"invoked the idea that teaching that a person \u2018must feel guilt, anguish or other forms of psychological distress\u2019 should be banned.\" However, Blow left out that the bill referred to anyone who was forced to feel any such distress due to their \"race, color, sex, or national origin.\" The Times correction appeared in Tuesday's edition of the newspaper. NEW YORK TIMES OP-ED STATES DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING IT TOO EASY FOR REPUBLICANS TO WIN IN THE MIDTERMS \"A column on Monday about Gov. Ron De\u00adSantis mischaracterized a Florida bill that would ban the teaching of critical race theory,\" the Times wrote. \"It would prohibit promoting the concept that people \u2018must feel guilt, anguish or other forms of psychological distress because of actions, in which the individual played no part, committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex or national origin.\u2019 It would not ban lesson plans that may make people feel guilt.\" Blow's column, however, is largely the same as it was when it first appeared online Sunday. Journalist Jeryl Bier shared an image from the WayBack machine showing Blow's original language \u2013 \"This one invoked the idea that a lesson that may make a person \u2018feel guilt, anguish or other forms of psychological distress\u2019 should be banned.'\" \u2013 was nearly identical to how it reads now, using the term \"teaching\" rather than \"a lesson.\" Florida Gov.

(Photo by DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) (DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) The New York Times did not respond to a request for comment. Blow, who primarily writes pieces blasting Republicans, ripped into DeSantis as Donald Trump \"2.0\" and compared his policies to Jim Crow in the column. Like the Parental Rights in Education bill that DeSantis recently signed into law, the Stop WOKE Act has been the subject of fierce criticism and occasional misinformation. DESANTIS TAKES AIM AT CRT TRAINING IN SCHOOLS AND CORPORATE AMERICA A Miami-Dade chapter of the AFSCME,\u00a0the country's largest trade union for public employees, falsely claimed earlier this month that the bill prohibits the teaching of slavery and the Holocaust in public schools. DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw tweeted earlier this month that the governor \"proposed the Stop WOKE Act to provide protections from discriminatory DEI [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion] content in post secondary education and corporate workplaces.\" \"The left knows that most Americans support common sense legislation, including legislation that protects Floridians from CRT-inspired discrimination,\" Pushaw told Fox News Digital. \"So in order to attack Governor DeSantis, corporate media resorts to fabricating false narratives about Florida. The only surprise here is that the Times would actually issue a correction.\" DeSantis has called critical race theory \"state-sanctioned racism\" and is expected to sign the bill into law.

Fox News contributor Brit Hume provides insight into Ukraine and Russia's inability to reach a cease-fire as attacks escalate Russian state-aligned media outlet RIA posted and deleted an article over the weekend that hailed Vladimir Putin for victory over Ukraine as Russia helps usher in a supposed \"new world.\" In what some have already labeled an \"embarrassing and revealing\" mistake, RIA pushed the article out and quickly deleted it. The article carries a date and timestamp of Feb. 26 at 8 a.m. and remains web-archived and available via the WayBack Machine to read in full. The report starts off by underscoring the victory as \"restoring\" Russia\u2019s unity, not just geographically returning the country to its historical borders and reversing \"the tragedy of 1991,\" but also hailing the country\u2019s ability to overcome \"temporary division.\" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES A view of the central square following shelling of the City Hall building in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Tuesday, March 1, 2022.

The Ukrainian people have maintained a tenacious and staunch defense, thus far stymying the Russian army\u2019s advance and preventing Moscow from achieving victory by Feb. 26, as the article would indicate.

President Joe Biden has imposed\u00a0 travel restrictions into the United States due to coronavirus fears despite previously slamming former President Trump as xenophobic for doing the same thing in 2020. \"We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus,\" Biden tweeted as a presidential candidate last year the day after Trump imposed travel restrictions from China into the United States in response to the spread of the coronavirus. \"We need to lead the way with science \u2014 not Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.\" Medical doctor giving injection to make antibody for coronavirus TRUMP'S THANKSGIVING MESSAGE TEASES 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUN The day before, in addition to the travel restriction from China, Trump issued a proclamation extending his \"travel ban\" to six additional countries that included Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania. Trump's initial travel ban, issued in 2017, set new criteria for visa applicants and refugees from six predominantly Muslim countries over concerns that individuals coming from those countries could not be properly vetted. Biden later attempted to walk back the xenophobic comment and claimed during a debate that he was making a broad point about xenophobia and not directly referring to the travel ban. \"A wall will not stop the coronavirus,\" Biden tweeted in March of 2020. \"Banning all travel from Europe \u2014 or any other part of the world \u2014 will not stop it. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet \u2014 and we need a plan to combat it.\" TOM COTTON BLASTS BIDEN WHITE HOUSE ON LACK OF AFGHAN REFUGEE VETTING President Joe Biden points to the Oval Office of the White House as he arrives on Marine One on the South Lawn in Washington, Sunday, Nov. 21, 2021, as he returns from Wilmington, Del.

The travel restrictions will apply to South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi.

Politico columnist Jack Shafer took aim at the Washington Post for the way it went about correcting its past reports on the infamous Steele dossier. The Post stunned the media landscape last week for issuing major corrections following revelations from the ongoing Durham probe that undermined the paper's previous corroboration of claims made in the memo from ex-British spy Christopher Steele, which helped ignite the Russia collusion narrative during the Trump presidency. WASHINGTON POST CORRECTS, REMOVES REPORTING THAT RELIED ON DISCREDITED ANTI-TRUMP STEELE DOSSIER \"The Washington Post on Friday took the unusual step of correcting and removing large portions of two articles, published in March 2017 and February 2019, that had identified a Belarusan American businessman as a key source of the \u2018Steele dossier,\u2019 a collection of largely unverified reports that claimed the Russian government had compromising information about then-candidate Donald Trump,\" Post media reporter Paul Farhi wrote. \"The newspaper\u2019s executive editor, Sally Buzbee, said The Post could no longer stand by the accuracy of those elements of the story. It had identified businessman Sergei Millian as \u2018Source D,\u2019 the unnamed figure who passed on the most salacious allegation in the dossier to its principal author, former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele,\" Farhi continued. (ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images) In a piece titled, \"Let\u2019s Not Consign Journalistic Transparency to the Memory Hole,\" Shafer defended a principle once championed by newspapers that its articles are \"the first rough draft of history,\" even if that first draft isn't completely accurate. \"So when reporters uncover new information that undermines earlier copy, they write new stories, updating the record. What they don\u2019t do is go back and erase the original, flawed version. But that\u2019s what the Washington Post did last week,\" Shafer wrote on Tuesday. Shafer saluted the Post for issuing corrections and praised its media critic Erik Wemple for his ongoing coverage calling out news outlets that hyped the Steele Dossier but accused Buzbee of \"masking the editorial record,\" writing \"What\u2019s peculiar about the Post\u2019s method of error correction was its decision to vaporize the two original stories.\" WAPO MEDIA CRITIC SAYS DURHAM INDICTMENT IS \u2018BAD NEWS\u2019 FOR THOSE WHO HYPED STEELE DOSSIER A Post spokesperson told Shafer the original reports could be found in the media database service Factiva, but the Politico columnist noted it costs roughly $249 a month, something many readers cannot afford. Shafer wrote, \"Such heavy reworking of years-old copy is so rare it approaches the unprecedented, as American University media history professor W. Joseph Campbell told Farhi. Stephen Bates, a professor of journalism at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, concurs. \u2018It\u2019s hard to have a paper of record if the record keeps changing,\u2019 Bates says.\" The Washington Post corrected its coverage of Christopher Steele\u2019s infamous dossier after the indictment of Igor Danchenko.\u00a0 (Reuters/Getty Images) The Politico senior media writer stressed his \"main beef\" isn't that the Post \"flubbed\" a story, something that frequently occurs for news outlets but rather \"how the paper should handle its flubs in the light of new information.\" He acknowledged \"such corrections require moderate bits of rewriting,\" pointing to a 2019 Russiagate report from Politico that was revised to reflect the Post's recent correction. \"Accountability requires journalists to show how their work was flawed if they choose to correct or retract,\" Shafer wrote before citing other examples of the Post and the New York Times' handling of erroneous reporting. \u00a0\"This sort of transparency is superior to the rewrite and erase strategy the Post just deployed. Readers shouldn\u2019t have to purchase pricey news databases to determine what newspapers originally published. But not all is lost. Thanks to the Internet Archive, the enterprising can retrieve the Post\u2019s vanquished pages.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Back in pre-web days, the best way to keep tabs on a newspaper\u2019s honesty quotient\u2026 was to clip stories or check microfilm. Then came the web, and it became an easy matter to dial up a newspaper\u2019s back pages. But no more. At some publications, the written record can be expunged if it contains embarrassing information. Now the Post is tossing old, flawed stories down the memory hole. Is this how journalism dies \u2026 in darkness?\" Shafer added. A spokesperson for the Post told Fox News, \"We were transparent with our readers in the editor\u2019s notes we added to the stories, ensuring that they understood what was removed and why.\" Fox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.

In media news today, The Daily Beast gets thrashed for saying Ted Cruz defended Nazi salutes, Biden takes no questions before jetting off to Europe, and MSNBC's Chuck Todd and New York Times' Kara Swisher complain about Facebook's impact on the media USA Today was caught stealth-editing multiple pieces after its sports columnist decried the \"racist\" Atlanta Braves team name. Bob Nightengale, USA Today's MLB writer, penned a piece Wednesday titled \"MLB, club won't budge on Atlanta baseball team's nickname, but here's why I won't use it\" that began by listing the \"blatantly racist\" caricatures and the \"offensive\" mascot that were previously removed and how headdresses, face paint and the famous \"tomahawk chop\" chant at games became \"strongly discouraged.\" USA TODAY EDITS STACEY ABRAMS OP-ED PUBLISHED BEFORE MLB PULLED GAME FROM ATLANTA, WATERS DOWN BOYCOTT SUPPORT \"In recent years, I have tried to avoid using Atlanta\u2019s nickname in\u00a0columns,\" Nightengale wrote. \"I find it offensive, and after talking and listening to Native American leaders, friends and associates, it only fortifies my belief.\" \"Copy editors have occasionally changed it in my copy because until now this has been my private stance. Several readers picked up on the name appearing in my articles during Atlanta\u2019s World Series run, and after talking it over with my editors, I have decided to explain my stance here and make more of a concerted effort\u00a0to keep the name out of my columns,\" Nightengale added. (Photo by Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos via Getty Images) Nightengale went on to clarify that he has \"the utmost respect for the club and the class and dignity of Henry Aaron lives and breathes throughout the\u00a0organization\" but that \"I just hate its\u00a0nickname, believing it\u2019s racist and offensive, and stunned at the hardened stance club leaders have\u00a0taken.\" Observers on social media noticed not only has Nigthengale used the word \"Braves\" on Twitter, his previous coverage of the Atlanta team faced a makeover. USA TODAY ISSUES CORRECTION ON \u2018FACT CHECK\u2019 AFTER CLAIMING BIDEN CHECKED WATCH \u2018ONLY AFTER CEREMONY\u2019 AT DOVER Nightengale's column from Saturday originally had the headline, \"Sweet revenge: Atlanta Braves knock off Los Angeles Dodgers to advance to World Series,\" according to The Wayback Machine. That was since changed to read, \"Sweet revenge: Atlanta knocks off Los Angeles Dodgers to advance to World Series.\" Every reference to the \"Braves\" was removed from the piece. (Photo by Rob Tringali/MLB Photos via Getty Images) The stealth-editing similarly occurred with an Oct. 18 piece, originally titled, \"Mighty Dodgers are reeling, frustrated after two walk-off NLCS wins for the Braves,\" now titled \"Mighty Dodgers are reeling, frustrated after two walk-off NLCS wins for Atlanta.\" All uses of the word \"Braves\" in the piece were also scrubbed. Both articles were timestamped as \"updated\" on Oct. 25, two days before Nightengale's piece slamming the Braves team name was published. No editor's note was initially added acknowledging the changes, though one of them included an unrelated correction. A spokesperson for Gannett, USA Today's parent company, referred to the stealth-edits as an \"oversight,\" telling Fox News the stories have been \"corrected\" with an editor's note, which reads, \"A previous version of this column was edited to remove the team name after it had been originally published. Due to an editing change, the team name was inserted without the author\u2019s knowledge.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This isn't the first time USA Today was caught stealth-editing. In April, the newspaper faced intense backlash for allowing prominent Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams to make changes to a March op-ed that justified calls for an Atlanta boycott after the MLB moved its All-Star Game from the city amid the uproar of Georgia's GOP-backed election reform bill. A Gannett spokesperson told Fox News at the time, \"We regret the oversight in updating the Stacey Abrams column. As soon as we recognized there was no editor\u2019s note, we added it to the page to reflect her changes. We have reviewed our procedures to ensure this does not occur again.\" Joseph A.

In media news today, MSNBC remains silent after Rachel Maddow and Joy Reid amplified a false ivermectin overdose story, left-wing media celebrates the Biden admin's move to oust Trump appointees from military panels, and The New York Times defends Gavin Newsom against recall The Los Angeles Times appears to have stealth-edited a report about the turmoil of pro-women group Time's Up, scrubbing any reference of Biden accuser Tara Reade. On Saturday, the paper published an article on the exodus of the Time's Up leadership that has parted ways with the organization following the revelations that its top officials were secretly aiding Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo as he began facing allegations of sexual harassment. Among those who resigned included Democratic operative and CNN contributor Hilary Rosen. The report referenced Rosen's apparent efforts to secretly \"discredit\" Reade, a charge that's been leveled by Reade and her backers. TARA READE TIPS TINA TCHEN FOR OFFERING NO APOLOGY AMID TIME'S UP EXIT: THEY CAUSED PAIN AND HARM TO SURVIVORS \"Supporters of Tara Reade, who alleged that President Biden harassed her in 1993, have claimed that Rosen worked behind the scenes to discredit Reade and other women who have accused powerful Democratic men of wrongdoing,\" the Times originally wrote. \"Rosen wasn\u2019t immediately available to comment on the group\u2019s announcement, made in a statement on its website Saturday.\" However, according to the internet archival website The Wayback Machine, that reference to Reade disappeared the next day without any sort of editor's note. It was replaced with a watered-down paragraph about Rosen, which read, \"Some have criticized the involvement of Rosen, who is vice-chair of the powerful Washington, D.C., public relations firm SKDKnickerbocker and a high-profile Democratic operative. Rosen declined to comment.\" The Times did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. Reade had previously alleged that Rosen reached out to the digital news outlet Law & Crime about a March 2020 report it wrote just days after she came forward with her assault allegation against Biden. The report listed financial transactions between SKDKnickerbocker, the PR partner for the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, and the Biden campaign during the 2019-2020 presidential election cycle as Reade sought financial aid from the group but was ultimately turned away. According to Reade, she was told at the time by Law & Crime's Colin Kalmbacher, who authored the report, that Rosen called the editor and went over the article \"line by line\" and that she urged the outlet not to \"lift\" or \"elevate\" Reade in any more stories. Law & Crime went on to publish several other reports about the Biden accuser. BIDEN ACCUSER TARA READE THREATENS TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST WASHINGTON POST: \u2018I\u2019M FIGHTING BACK' Fox News reached out to Kalmbacher for comment but received a response from Law & Crime editor-in-chief Rachel Stockman, who confirmed that Rosen \"did reach out to our editor to discuss and critique our coverage\" but stressed, \"Not a word was changed or altered as a result of that conversation.\" However, Stockman did not respond to Fox News' inquiry about the details of that conservation, including if Rosen urged Law & Crime to no longer cover Reade. Rosen did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. Last month, The Washington Post reported about Rosen's alleged involvement in the shielding of Andrew Cuomo in supporting Time's Up decision not to issue a statement responding to the sexual harassment claim made by Cuomo's first accuser, former aide Lindsey Boylan, when Fox News reached out to the group for comment back in December 2020. Rosen was allegedly concerned about the negative impact of giving Fox News \"a headline to run all day.\" She told the Post that she thought \"serious allegations of sexual harassment should not be politicized\" in an attempt to explain her objection. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Reade, who wrote the\u00a0memoir\u00a0\"Left Out: When the Truth Doesn't Fit In\" about her experience coming forward with her assault allegation, was one of\u00a0eight women who came forward in 2019 to accuse the then-Democratic candidate of inappropriate touching when she worked for him as a Senate staffer. A year later, Reade revealed her sexual assault claim on \"The Katie Halper Show.\" Biden repeatedly denied her claims on the campaign trail. Before going public, Reade sought help from the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund\u00a0in January 2020 to help defray the costs of public relations and legal fees. However, while the organization offered attorney referrals, she said they denied her funding, citing concerns it could\u00a0affect its nonprofit 501(c)(3) status as her allegation is against a politician actively running for office.

A bail fund once backed by Vice President Kamala Harris helped free an alleged domestic abuser who is now accused of murder. George Howard, 48, allegedly became involved in a road rage altercation on an Interstate 94 entrance ramp before he shot another driver, according to Minneapolis police \u2013 weeks after bailing out on domestic assault charges. Surveillance video recorded the moments when the driver of a blue BMW confronted Howard, who was driving a white Volvo, according to St. Paul\u2019s KSTP-TV. The victim can be seen punching Howard, then collapsing. The victim, later identified as Luis Damian Martinez Ortiz, 38, got back into his car, then drove into the median. He was pronounced dead at the hospital with a gunshot wound to the chest, according to city officials. Howard had been out on $11,500 bond in connection with a domestic assault case since Aug. 6, court records show. That\u2019s when the Minnesota Freedom Fund bailed him out. On Aug. 29, he was charged with two counts of second-degree murder in connection with the interstate shooting. The Minnesota Freedom Fund tweeted Friday admitting to its role putting Howard back on the streets. On Tuesday, the thread was inaccessible on Twitter but preserved by the Internet Archive. George Howard (Hennepin County Sheriff's Office) MINNESOTA GROUP BAILED OUT ALLEGED VIOLENT CRIMINALS \"We are aware of reports of the tragic and fatal shooting in Minneapolis earlier this week allegedly involving George Howard, an individual the Minnesota Freedom Fund had previously provided with bail support,\" the group wrote. \"MFF believes that every individual who has been arrested by the law enforcement is innocent until proven guilty, and if a judge deems them eligible for bail, they should not have to wait in jail simply because they don\u2019t have the same income or access to resources as others.\" The group said it was monitoring the case and reviewing its policies. \"Under new leadership, MFF has implemented changes to its policies and procedures, and we will continue to assess them to ensure that we are being responsive to the safety and needs of our community,\" it said in a follow-up tweet. Harris had promoted the bail group during the 2020 campaign, urging her Twitter followers to donate to the group in June of that year. A spokesperson for the vice president declined to comment Tuesday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"If you\u2019re able to, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund \u00a0to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota,\" she wrote, linking to the group\u2019s donation site on ActBlue, a Democratic PAC. Once funds are received the donors have no say in whose bail they go to covering, and the Freedom Fund has drawn criticism along the way, with reports that it had been bailing out violent criminals cropping up as early as last August. Minneapolis-based FOX 9 reported that the fund spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to free an alleged knife murderer and a convicted rapist who was facing charges of sexual assault and kidnapping, among others.

Senator Jon Tester, D-Mont., on Tuesday quietly released his public schedule on his Senate website between April 14 and April 20 after not updating his public schedule for almost three months, which broke\u00a0his campaign pledge to be transparent about with whom he meets. Tester pledged to publicize his official calendar\u00a0dating back to his 2006 Senate campaign, but his public schedule appeared to be non-existent over the last few months when important issues like filibuster reform, the stimulus, and other important issues were being discussed. Tester's public schedule was archived nearly a dozen times between February 1 and April 19, only showing Tester's schedule during the last week in January, according to the Internet Archive's\u00a0Wayback Machine. On April 20, Tester's schedule was updated to show his schedule between April 14 and April 20. \"Due to a staff error, Senator Tester\u2019s public schedule was not posted online from Jan-28-April 20,\" Tester's communications director, Sarah Feldman, told Fox News in an emailed statement. \"Upon learning of the error we immediately corrected the issue, and those dates are now online where everyone can see. Senator Tester is proud to be the first Senator in either party to post his daily public schedule and will continue providing the transparency that Montanans and all Americans deserve from their elected leaders.\" FRESHMAN SEN. JON TESTER POSTS DAILY SCHEDULE TO FULFILL CAMPAIGN PROMISE The senator\u2019s online calendar has been a staple of his political persona since his first Senate campaign. During his 2018 re-election campaign, one of his press releases touted that he \"was the first member of Congress and is still the only member of Montana's Congressional Delegation to post his daily public schedule on his website.\" A 2007 report from the Associated Press confirmed that Tester was fulfilling his campaign promise of updating his calendar, which the report said would illustrate whether he\u2019s working out, spending time with family or meeting with lobbyists and special interest groups. Tester has touted himself as the first public official to post his daily schedule online, warts and all, and signed an ethics pledge in 2006 promising he would \"ban all lobbyist gifts, meals and travel paid for by outside sources\" as well as \"ban secret meetings with lobbyists.\" \"As far as myself is concerned, I think that the level of responsibility and accountability that I\u2019ve brought to Washington, D.C. are \u2013 and transparency \u2013 are unmeasured,\" Tester said during a Senate race debate in 2012. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I was the first person to put my schedule online, first person to do an audit, first person to carry bills that really make Washington, D.C.\u2019s government look a lot like Montana\u2019s,\" Tester continued. Tester boasts about his calendar on his website\u2019s \"Biography\" and \"Accountability and Transparency\" pages, with the latter saying Tester is \"the only member of the Montana delegation to post his daily public schedule online.\" An earlier version of this story said Tester's office didn't respond to an email seeking comment; the email was sent to the wrong address.

Arizona congresswoman weighs in on the influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border on 'FOX News Live' President Joe Biden\u2019s \"come one, come all,\" promises and policies have turned the U.S.-Mexico border into a humanitarian catastrophe, a public-health calamity, and a national-security crisis. Biden also has transformed America\u2019s southern frontier into a gigantic crime scene. The border criminals include every illegal alien who invades America without permission. They undermine U.S. sovereignty, fleece beleaguered American taxpayers, and mock millions of immigrants who arrive legally. Foreigners who breach the border without passports violate \u200b8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1325(a) \u2014 Improper entry by alien. RNC CHAIR MCDANIEL: WHERE'S KAMALA? BIDEN'S BORDER POINT PERSON CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO SHOW UP. HERE'S WHY Border Patrol encounters with such illegal immigrants\u00a0soared from 36,687 in February 2020 to 100,441 in February 2021 \u2014 up 173 percent. The analogous figures for March 2020 were 34,460 and, according to strictly preliminary data, 171,700 for March 2021 \u2014 up 71 percent since last month and 398 percent, year on year. Even more nefarious are apprehensions of aliens with criminal convictions. President Donald J. Trump slashed these from 4,269 in FY 2019 to 2,438 in FY 2020 \u2014 down 42.9 percent. Customs and Border Protection reports that, for FY 2021 to date (October 1, 2020 through last February 28) that number swelled to 4,140 \u2014 up 69.8 percent. \"Here we are, not even halfway through FY 2021, and a year\u2019s worth of criminal aliens [compared to FY 2019] already have been encountered by the Border Patrol,\" Jessica M. Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies with the Center for Immigration Studies, tells me. \"That\u2019s alarming, and suggests that the criminal aliens feel empowered by Biden\u2019s welcome-wagon policies.\" These criminals have ugly rap sheets. In Texas\u2019 Rio Grande Valley Sector, \"a Salvadoran man with a prior conviction for murder was discovered,\" CBP\u2019s Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings revealed March 27 via Twitter. For FY 2021 to date, \"RGV agents have arrested over 861 criminal aliens, to include 63 gang members and 92 sex offenders.\" Even scarier than these specific arrests are the border-wide convictions for other illegals captured this fiscal year: \u2022Homicide - three \u2022Illegal weapons possession and trafficking - 140 \u2022Sexual offenses - 210 \u2022Burglary, robbery, larceny, theft, and fraud - 308 \u2022Assault, battery, and domestic violence - 484 \u2022Driving under the influence - 715 \u2022Illegal drug possession and trafficking \u2013 816 Convictions across these seven categories totaled 1,672 in FY 2019. Trump cut them to 1,309 in FY 2020 \u2014 down 21.7 percent. FY 2021 to date: 2,676 \u2014 up 104.4 percent. Others got away. Even more menacing, Axios reported on March 16 that three Yemenis and a Serb on the FBI\u2019s\u00a0Terrorism Watch List\u00a0have been nabbed at the border since October. (Courtesy: U.S. Customs & Border Protection) Then, on Monday, a CBP press release datelined \"CALEXICO, Calif.\" announced that the Border Patrol caught two Yemeni men on the southern frontier. Both were on the FBI\u2019s Terrorism Watch List and the No-Fly List. In one of these\u00a0cases, the news release states, \"agents found a cellular phone sim card hidden underneath the insole of his shoe.\" Oddly enough, this April 5 CBP press release vanished from the agency\u2019s website. At this writing, this communiqu\u00e9\u2019s URL yields a page that brusquely declares: \"Access denied.\" This smells like yet another example of Team Biden covering up evidence of their totally destructive policies on the border. (Biden\u2019s enforcers asked senators who visited federal facilities last week to delete photos they snapped of unaccompanied minors who were about as socially distanced as canned anchovies.) Thankfully, the priceless Wayback Machine/Internet Archive captured this document before it tumbled down an Orwellian memory hole. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Here is a link to CBP\u2019s deleted, and now resurrected,\u00a0press release. The agency did not respond to requests for comment. Aside from these Yemenis and this Serb, how many others on the Terrorism Watch List have slipped through amid Biden\u2019s border bedlam? Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s human-trafficking bonanza is huge business for seriously bad guys. \"We just come here to earn our daily bread, like everyone else,\" a smuggler who calls himself \"Lily\" told Univision on March 26. Standing in the shallow Rio Grande, beside the small boat that he uses to ferry illegals across the river from Mexico to America, \"Lily\" adds, \"In all honesty, there are way too many people. Believe me. With the benefits your new president is now granting, people found the courage to come.\" And how much \"bread\" do these traffickers collect per alien escorted? CBP figures suggest that 100,441 illegals typically paid some $4,096 each to surge the border in February. This averages $14.7 million per day, $411.5 million that month, or a cool $5.365 billion per year. This illicit sum exceeds the 2020 sales revenues of Hyatt Hotels ($5.02 billion), Western Union ($5.29 billion), and Harley Davidson ($5.36 billion). Traffickers likely pay no taxes. \"It\u2019s so lucrative that the smugglers will not easily be deterred from doing this business,\" immigration scholar Jessica Vaughan worries. \"More and more will want to get into the act, bringing people from all over the world; and the more money they make, the more money they will have \u2014 to bribe officials, hire and pay more employees, and acquire weapons, vehicles, and technology to evade law enforcement.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If those who seek better lives in America visited U.S. embassies, acquired visas, and landed at American airports, most of this chaos and mayhem would go unperpetrated. Instead, this new administration has engineered the conditions under which international hoodlums prey on, profit from, and even kill other human beings. In just more than two months, a \"nice guy\" named Joe Biden has distinguished himself as the trans-border criminal\u2019s best friend.

The URL \"petitions.whitehouse.gov\" currently redirects to the White House's homepage instead of the original page, which was initially set up under former President Obama in 2011. It's unclear why the redirect occurs but an internet archive shows the original \"We the People\" page appearing as far back as the day of President Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20. Notable recent petitions have included a request that Trump release his taxes, one requesting that Antifa be classified as a terrorist organization, and another that pushed for the government to create a Death Star.

Ben Domenech, Leo Terrell, Carley Shimkus and Rachel Campos-Duffy weigh in 'The Big Sunday Show' The Washington Post fawned over President Biden\u2019s stimulus package with a glowing headline that read to critics like a partisan press release more than a serious news story. The Post story, \"Biden stimulus showers money on Americans, sharply cutting poverty in defining move of presidency,\"\u00a0 celebrated the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill\u00a0that passed on party lines Saturday in the Democratic-controlled\u00a0Senate.

Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest from the transition on 'Special Report' President Biden's pick for director of the White House Office of Management and Budget could find herself in unfriendly territory when she sits for two confirmation hearings this week after a history of enmity with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Neera Tanden will appear before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday and the Senate Budget Committee on Wednesday. She may find herself having to answer for a number of inflammatory tweets against Republicans \u2013 messages the Daily Beast reported she deleted in November prior to the announcement of her nomination. Many of those messages have been preserved by the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. SANDERS DODGES QUESTIONS ON WHETHER HE'LL CONFIRM RIVAL NEERA TANDEN FOR OMB \"The whole [Republican] party needs to be defeated in November,\" Tanden said in 2018, blasting the GOP for supporting former President Donald Trump, whom she implied was racist. This was after Trump thanked then-White House chief of staff John Kelly for \"firing that dog,\" in reference to Omarosa Manigault Newman. In 2017 Tanden also accused the GOP, as well as \"everyone who gives money to the RNC,\" of \"gleefully supporting an alleged child molester,\" in reference to Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who had been accused of sexually assaulting females \u2013 including underage girls \u2013 in the past. Tanden has also singled out specific Republican senators. She has referred to former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as \"MoscowMitch,\" implying that he was working on behalf of Russia. She also once called Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and then-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., \"criminally ignorant.\" Tanden also went after Collins in October 2018 after the senator\u00a0said she would vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh despite allegations of sexual misconduct in his teen years brought by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. \"Susan Collins\u2019 terrible treatment of Dr. Ford should haunt Collins the rest of her days,\" Tanden said. BIDEN'S OMB PICK NEERA TANDEN ANGERS BERNIE SANDERS-ALLIED PROGRESSIVES Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told the New York Post in December after Tanden\u2019s nomination that her past comments could come back to haunt her. \"I think, in light of her combative and insulting comments about many members of the Senate, mainly on our side of the aisle, that it creates certainly a problematic path,\" Cornyn told the New York Post. Tanden also has been at odds with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who chairs the Budget Committee that will host her on Wednesday. The OMB nominee has close ties to Sanders\u2019 2016 primary opponent Hillary Clinton. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP During the presidential primary race in 2019, Sanders wrote a fiery\u00a0letter\u00a0to the Center for American Progress, which Tanden led, accusing her of \"maligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas.\" The Vermont senator, a self-described democratic socialist, also criticized a\u00a0video\u00a0by ThinkProgress,\u00a0a project of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, which accused him of changing his rhetoric on wealthy Americans after he became a millionaire in 2016.

Meena Harris, the industrious and outspoken niece of Vice President Kamala Harris, is creating an optics issue for the White House. Meena, 36, flew to the Inauguration on the private plane of a Biden inaugural donor and\u00a0 posted about the trip on her Instagram stories. The Stanford and Harvard Law graduate has a children\u2019s book about her aunt and mother that\u2019s No. 4 on the New York Times bestseller list-- \"Kamala and Maya\u2019s Big Idea.\" MILWAUKEE, WI - AUGUST 19: In this screenshot from the DNCC\u2019s livestream of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Meena Harris, niece of Kamala Harris, addresses the virtual convention on August 19, 2020. (Photo by DNCC via Getty Images) (Photo by Handout/DNCC via Getty Images) (Getty Images) The book was published in June 2020, before Kamala was vice president, and thus breaks no laws. But White House officials told Politico the book couldn\u2019t have been published today because it uses Kamala\u2019s name and likeness. It\u2019s unclear whether Meena is allowed to continue to draw royalties for the book, and she won\u2019t say if she still is. After members of President Biden\u2019s family appeared to profit off his political sway during his years as senator and vice president, the White House has tried to distance itself from any further ethical violations. \"It's the White House's policy that the president's name should not be used in connection with any commercial activities to suggest or in any way, in any way they could reasonably be understood to imply his endorsement or support,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday. KAMALA HARRIS' STEPDAUGHTER ELLA EMHOFF SIGNS CONTRACT WITH IMG MODELS In December, transition lawyers said they were drafting new ethics rules for business ventures of the Biden and Harris families that \"are likely to be more restrictive than the rules that governed the Obama administration,\" according to The Washington Post. The VP\u2019s office is taking the same stance. \"The Vice President and her family will uphold the highest ethical standards and it\u2019s the White House\u2019s policy that the Vice President's name should not be used in connection with any commercial activities that could reasonably be understood to imply an endorsement or support,\" Sabrina Singh, spokesperson for the vice president, said in a statement to Politico. The day after the inauguration, transition ethics lawyers had to tell Meena she could not continue to sell a number of items for her clothing brand Phenomenal that beared her aunt\u2019s name-- the \"Kamala Harris Swimsuit,\" \"phenomenal Kamala Tank,\" and\u00a0 \"Kamala T-shirt.\" The items that appeared last fall are no longer listed on her site. SEE INSIDE BLAIR HOUSE, KAMALA HARRIS' TEMPORARY HOME IN WASHINGTON Phenomenal has sold other items referencing Kamala during the campaign, including a sweatshirt MVP, standing for \"Madam Vice President,\" and another with the phrase \"I'm speaking\" on the front, alluding to Kamala\u2019s repeated line during her debate with former Vice President Mike Pence. After Biden picked Kamala as his running mate in August, Meena convinced the Biden team to sell a shirt in the campaign store bearing her name and that of fellow influencer Cleo Wade. The shirt read \"THE FIRST BUT NOT THE LAST,\" alongside a picture of a young Kamala, referencing Kamala\u2019s historical swearing-in as first female vice president. The Biden campaign agreed, but by Sept. 6, Meena\u2019s name had been removed as a collaborator, according to an internet archive\u00a0dug up by Politico. \"For appearance sake, Meena\u2019s name was removed because we didn\u2019t want to make it seem or appear that she would be benefiting or profiting from the campaign,\" a White House official said, adding that neither Meena nor Wade made any money off the shirt. This month, Meena was slapped on the hand again by ethics lawyers when in a collaboration with Beats by Dre, her clothing company adorned the same phrase \"The First But Not The Last,\" to Beats headphones they mailed out to influencers and celebrities ahead of the inauguration. The Biden team was not made aware of the collaboration in advance, according to Axios. In her latest venture, Meena announced weeks after the election she was starting a production company with former Obama White House staffer Brad Jenkins, Phenomenal Productions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The day before Inauguration Day, Supermajority Education Fund released an ad featuring clips of Kamala that Meena and the company produced. The White House reportedly said it did not know if Meena was paid for her time producing the ad, but if she was it would be a violations of ethics. Asked if she was paid by Supermajority, Meena didn\u2019t respond. Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

Tom Cotton said on Wednesday. \u201cThe problem with Neera Tanden is not so much her tweets, it\u2019s her radical liberal ideas,\u201d the Arkansas Republican told \"Fox & Friends.\" \u201cThis is a woman who wants Congress to hold up coronavirus relief for the American people so we can give checks to illegal immigrants.

Michelle Obama coined the phrase during the 2016 presidential campaign in response to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's personal insults against Hillary Clinton, the media and many others.

It\u2019s just another example of how Joe Biden is going back to the Obama-Biden era, where we\u2019re going to have more taxes and more regulations, not have a government that stands with and stands beside the American people, but rather one that tries to ride the back of the American people with one-size-fits-all policies coming from Washington.\u201d Joshua Q.

Tanden has also drawn scrutiny for once allegedly punching a journalist after he asked a tough question to Clinton during an interview, though, according to the New York Times, she said she \"pushed\" the reporter and did not \"slug\" him.

Fox News chief White House correspondent John Roberts joins 'Your World' with the latest C-SPAN announced Thursday it had suspended\u00a0political editor\u00a0Steve Scully indefinitely after he admitted he lied about his\u00a0Twitter\u00a0account being hacked, but the scandal has also renewed interest in\u00a0hacker claims once made by MSNBC host Joy Reid -- and some critics think C-SPAN handled the issue properly while MSNBC fell flat. \"Scully was held to a higher standard because he and C-SPAN purported to be neutral responsible journalists acting in a non-partisan manner. There is no such presumption, or pretense, for Joy Reid and MSNBC,\u201d Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson told Fox News. C-SPAN SUSPENDS STEVE SCULLY INDEFINITELY AFTER HE ADMITS HE LIED ABOUT HIS TWITTER BEING HACKED C-SPAN suspended Steve Scully indefinitely after he admitted he lied about being hacked, but the scandal has renewed interest in hacker claims once made by MSNBC host Joy Reid. Scully, who was set to moderate the since-canceled presidential debate, lied\u00a0after\u00a0a message to former Trump aide-turned-adversary Anthony Scaramucci\u00a0went viral. It appeared that he meant to send\u00a0Scaramucci a private message seeking advice about Trump, but instead sent the message on his Twitter feed for everyone to see.\u00a0He initially claimed his account was hacked but ultimately fessed up and was\u00a0swiftly\u00a0suspended. It wasn\u2019t the first time a\u00a0prominent media member\u00a0blamed hackers\u00a0for\u00a0something that landed them in hot water. Back in late 2017, it was revealed that the Reid\u2019s pre-MSNBC\u00a0blog, \u201cThe Reid Report,\u201d contained dozens of homophobic and hateful posts.\u00a0She initially apologized, but when a\u00a0second batch of offensive comments surfaced\u00a0\u2012 about some lesbians' short haircuts and her objections to seeing men kiss men, among other homophobic remarks\u00a0\u2012 Reid\u00a0then claimed she\u2019d been hacked, and MSNBC circulated a much-panned statement from a computer hacking \u201cexpert\u201d which sought to make that case. MEDIA LARGELY AVOIDS STEVE SCULLY CONTROVERSY, TV NETWORKS SKIP DEBATE MODERATOR'S 'HACK' CLAIM Upon scrutiny,\u00a0skeptics said\u00a0Reid\u2019s claims didn\u2019t pass muster.\u00a0The Daily Beast, which\u00a0had suspended Reid as a contributor,\u00a0conducted\u00a0its own investigation and concluded that claims made by Reid\u2019s cyber-security expert Jonathan Nichols that \u201cscreenshot manipulation\u201d took place were false. Critics have pointed to the Internet archival service The\u00a0Wayback\u00a0Machine, which showed that the anti-gay articles were preserved at the time they were written and refuted the suggestion that hackers could have manipulated their archives.\u00a0Others joked that time-traveling hackers must have been responsible. She has since maintained that she does not remember writing the hateful\u00a0posts, but\u00a0apologized anyway. Some\u00a0were quick\u00a0to\u00a0criticize\u00a0Reid\u2019s apology for not mentioning the\u00a0dubious hacker claims\u00a0--\u00a0for which she reportedly alerted the FBI about the hacking \u201ccrime.\u201d Reid has since been promoted and hosts the weekday timeslot\u00a0long occupied by Chris Matthews\u2019 \u201cHardball\u201d until he\u00a0left the network\u00a0amid sexual misconduct allegations. MSNBC BREAKS SILENCE ON STAR JOY REID\u2019S \u2018HATEFUL\u2019 BLOG POSTS: \u2018SHE HAS GROWN AND EVOLVED\u2019 \u201cThis confirms, yet again, that being on the Left means never having to say you're sorry.\" When asked about the scandal by the New York Times earlier this year, Reid said, \u201cIt\u2019s two years ago, so I don\u2019t spend a whole lot of time thinking about that old blog. What I genuinely believe is that I truly care about the L.G.B.T. people in my own life. I care about being a good ally, a good person, and making sure that my voice is authentic, that I can make a difference.\" MSNBC stood by Reid throughout the ordeal\u00a0and did not immediately respond when asked if the network still maintains that her blog was hacked. Back in 2018,\u00a0MSNBC issued a statement after weeks of silence on the issue and said Reid \"has grown and evolved in the many years since\" since the hateful blog posts were published. Fox News contributor Deroy Murdock\u00a0agrees that\u00a0the two different ways the hacker claims were handled indicates\u00a0C-SPAN\u00a0has higher standards than the progressive cable news network. MSNBC PROMOTES JOY REID TO TAKE OVER WEEKNIGHT SLOT LEFT VACANT BY CHRIS MATTHEWS \"While C-Span is not exactly conservative, it remains fair and balanced. That's probably why they suspended political editor Steve Scully for lying about his Twitter account being hacked which, it turns out, it wasn't,\u201d Murdock\u00a0told Fox News. \u201cMeanwhile, MSNBC's far-Left Joy Reid claimed to have had her\u00a0[blog]\u00a0hacked, even though evidence of that is about as scant as the\u00a0\u2018proof\u2019\u00a0that failed actor Jussie Smollett was attacked by racist, white Trump supporters on a frigid night in Chicago last year,\u201d Murdock\u00a0added, referencing reports Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to rough him up, to garner sympathy and a better TV contract. Regardless, Reid has enjoyed promotions and an even higher profile at MSNBC.\u201d While Reid appologized, the lack of transparency about her hacker claim left\u00a0Murdock\u00a0unsatisfied. \u201cThis confirms, yet again, that being on the Left means never having to say you're sorry,\" Murdock said. Media Research Center vice president Dan Gainor thinks C-SPAN did the right thing\u00a0by suspending Scully, but wonders\u00a0if there will be long-term consequences. \u201cC-SPAN moved against Scully because their organization actually tries to have some ethics. MSNBC gave up on those long ago.\" \u201cC-SPAN moved against Scully because their organization actually tries to have some ethics. MSNBC gave up on those long ago. They gave blatant liar Brian Williams his own show, for goodness sakes. They only care that their hosts hate Trump,\u201d Gainor told Fox News. \u201cThe bigger question for both networks\u00a0is: are there long-term consequences to making false claims like this? Scully has claimed he\u2019s been hacked multiple times. Reid\u2019s bogus narrative involved the FBI,\u201d Gainor added.\u00a0\u201cWill either of their employers disavow this garbage? Scully issued a statement addressing his controversy to CNN following the announcement of his suspension. \"For several weeks, I was subjected to relentless criticism on social media and in conservative news outlets regarding my role as moderator for the second presidential debate, including attacks aimed directly at my family,\" Scully wrote. \"This culminated on Thursday, October 8th when I heard President Trump go on national television twice and falsely attack me by name. Out of frustration, I sent a brief tweet addressed to Anthony Scaramucci. The next morning when I saw that this tweet had created a controversy, I falsely claimed that my Twitter account had been hacked.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP C-SPAN also issued a statement, revealing that the network and the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD)\u00a0were made aware about Scully's fabrication on Wednesday. \"We are very saddened by this news and do not condone his actions,\" C-SPAN said. \"Starting immediately, we have placed Steve on administrative leave. After some distance from this episode, we believe in his ability to continue to contribute to C-SPAN.\" Fox News\u2019 Joseph A.\u00a0Wulfsohn\u00a0contributed to this report.

The deleted page was first reported by The Washington Examiner. The spotlight on some of BLM\u2019s more controversial positions comes during a decline in support for the group. A Pew Research poll released last week showed that just over half of American adults, at 55%, support the group, down from a high of 67% in June, when the nation was reeling from the death of George Floyd, a Black man, in the custody of Minneapolis police officers.

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany answers Fox News\u2019 Kristin Fisher\u2019s question on coronavirus concerns during the Trump rally in Tulsa. EXCLUSIVE:\u00a0Two federally-run Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals during the Obama administration used the term \"Kung Flu\" in official materials, along with imagery of a monkey in a karate suit and a ninja wearing a flu mask, Fox News has learned. President Trump's\u00a0use of the term\u00a0\u201cKung Flu\u201d to refer to the coronavirus has drawn accusations of racism and insensitivity, but the use of the term under the Obama administration has gone unreported. In 2015, the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System's official website urged patients to \"Become a Kung Flu Fighter! Get Your Flu Shot!\" The website has been taken down, but\u00a0a copy of it was retained by an Internet archiving website. The text was accompanied by an image of a ninja wearing a mask in an airborne, flying-kick posture. The VA further urged visitors to \"Click here to print Kung Flu Fighter poster!\" Also in 2015, the Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center sent a mailer to patients reading:\u00a0\"Kung Flu -- Knock it out before it knocks YOU out!\" The text is accompanied by a cartoon monkey in a karate outfit apparently kicking a virus molecule senseless. A copy of that mailer was still online on Wednesday afternoon, but was taken down\u00a0shortly after this article was published. However, the mailer was also\u00a0saved by an Internet archive service. It was unclear why the hospitals were referencing \"Kung Flu,\" other than to make an attempt at humor. Unlike now, the term was not used during a pandemic when an outbreak began in China, as it did with COVID-19. White House Press Secretary\u00a0Kayleigh McEnany\u00a0sparred with reporters\u00a0Monday about the term \"Kung Flu,\" declaring that the moniker was meant to link COVID-19\u00a0to\u00a0its place of origin. RICE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS DEMAND 'BLACK HOUSE,' BETTER ID PHOTOS Trump referred to the coronavirus\u00a0as \u201cKung Flu\u201d on Saturday night\u00a0during his campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla.\u00a0McEnany was asked about the phrase multiple times during the briefing Monday. CBS' Weijia Jiang, a Trump critic,\u00a0first brought up the topic, asking why the president uses \u201cracist\u201d terms such as \u201cKung Flu.\u201d\u00a0Jiang previously claimed that a White House offiical had used the term \"Kung Flu,\" but she has refused to name the official without explaining why. JIMMY KIMMEL CALLS FOR TRUMP 'N-WORD' TAPE ... FOX FINDS KIMMEL 'N-WORD' TAPE \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t, what the president does do is point to the fact that the origin of the virus is China. It\u2019s a fair thing to point out, as China tries to ridiculously rewrite history\u2026 ridiculously blame the coronavirus on American soldiers,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cThis is what China\u2019s trying to do and what President Trump is saying, \u2018No, China, I will label this virus for its place of origin.\u2019\u201d Jiang pushed back, repeating she feels the phrase is \u201cracist,\u201d but McEnany again responded that Trump is simply \u201clinking it to its place of origin\u201d and dismissed concerns that the phrase will lead to discrimination against Asian Americans. BIDEN HITS TRUMP FOR 'VERY FINE PEOPLE' COMMENT ... BUT BIDEN PRAISED 'FINE PEOPLE' IN CONFEDERACY GROUP \u201cThe president has said very clearly, 'It\u2019s important that we totally protect our Asian community in the U.S. and all around the world. They\u2019re amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form,'\u201d McEnany said. McEnany then said the mainstream media condemned Trump for calling COVID-19 the \u201cWuhan Virus\u201d and \u201cChinese Virus\u201d despite the press using those terms themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s a separate category, Kayleigh. \u2019Kung Flu\u2019 is extremely offensive to many people in the Asian American community,\u201d Jiang said. \u201cTo be clear, I think the media is trying to play games with the terminology of this virus\u2026 the focus should be on the fact that China let this out of their country,\u201d McEnany said, adding that CNN called it the \u201cWuhan Virus\u201d in January. TRUMP CAMPAIGN REJECTS CLAIMS THAT TIKTOK, K-POP FANS SABOTAGED RALLY: 'DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT' CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins then chimed in, saying the \u201cmedia has never called it the \u2018Kung Flu.\u2019\u201d \u201cCalling it the Chinese coronavirus and \u2018Kung Flu\u2019 are very different things,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe media, and your network specifically, have repeatedly used the term \u2018China Virus\u2019 and \u2018Wuhan Virus,\u2019 and then gone on to deride the president,\u201d McEnany hit back. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Collins repeated that the media hasn\u2019t used the term \u201cKung Flu,\u201d but McEnany attempted to move on to the next reporter. McEnany then answered questions on a variety of other topics, but reporters continued asking about the \u201cKung Flu\u201d and she continued responding by noting that coronavirus originated in China.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.  Fox News media analyst Howard Kurtz, host of 'MediaBuzz,' examines how media coverage of the allegation against Joe Biden compares with the handling of similar allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. When Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault in a\u00a0September 2018 interview with The Washington Post, prominent Democrats and media organizations rushed to the story -- demanding answers and, in many cases, the end of Kavanaugh's career. In the weeks after Tara Reade\u00a0publicly charged\u00a0in a podcast released March 25\u00a0that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993, however,\u00a0those same politicians and outlets have become either silent or equivocal -- even as mounting video and testimonial evidence\u00a0from several sources corroborates Reade's claim, where Ford presented no contemporaneous support for her allegations. A Fox News chronology, beginning the day of each accusation,\u00a0shows the extent to which Reade's claims have been handled differently from Ford's. Fox News has reached out to Democratic lawmakers for comment about Reade, but has not heard back. Similarly, not a single Democratic senator responded when The Daily Caller gave each lawmaker 24 hours to provide comment on Reade's allegations. SEPT. 16, 2018 Within minutes of The Washington Post's story outlining\u00a0Ford's claim that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a high school party more than three decades earlier, The New York Times immediately publishes a story stating that Kavanaugh's nomination was \"in turmoil.\" Ford presents\u00a0no\u00a0independently verifiable evidence that she had ever met Kavanaugh. CNN also reports the news immediately with an article. And another (likening the news to the Anita Hill testimony). And another (describing the White House as mounting an \"intense\" effort to squash the accusation.) And another (describing a senator's assessments of how Kavanaugh's nomination would go forward). And another (describing how Democrats would push for a delay in Kavanaugh's confirmation vote.) Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announces\u00a0her opposition to Kavanaugh. \u201cSupreme Court justices should not be an extension of the Republican Party,\" she says.\u00a0\"They must also have unquestionable character and integrity, and serious questions remain about Judge\u00a0Kavanaugh\u00a0in this regard, as indicated in information I referred to the FBI.\u201d (Feinstein had first received Ford's accusations weeks earlier, but chose not to release them to investigators or the media\u00a0until after Kavanaugh's initial confirmation\u00a0hearings had concluded.) Other Democratic lawmakers follow Feinstein's lead. MARCH\u00a025, 2020 \u201cIt happened all at once, and then \u2026 his hands were on me and underneath my clothes,\u201d Reade tells\u00a0podcast host Katie Halper. \u201cHe said \u2018come on, man, I heard you liked me. For me, it was like, everything shattered \u2026 I wanted to be a senator; I didn\u2019t want to sleep with one.\u201d Reade was a Senate staffer for Biden at the time. Reade\u00a0says\u00a0she told her brother, Collin Moulton, as well as her mother and a friend about the incident at the time. Both Moulton and the friend confirmed Reade's account\u00a0in interviews with The Intercept. (Reade's mother has died, but footage has emerged showing her calling into CNN at the time with a story about her daughter's problems with a prominent senator.) Meanwhile, CNN wonders,\u00a0\"Why is Bernie Sanders still running for president?\"\u00a0 The Reade claim is not mentioned on the network, either\u00a0on-air or\u00a0online. The New York Times publishes a story explaining that Biden was growing \"impatient\" with the idea of more debates with Bernie Sanders. The Reade claim is not mentioned anywhere in the paper, which had slammed Republicans in\u00a0August 2018\u00a0for \"covering up\" Kavanaugh's \"past.\" The Intercept reports\u00a0that a darling of the \"Me Too\" movement, the Time's\u00a0Up Legal Defense Fund, refused to help Reade with legal expenses, citing Biden's presidential run and its nonprofit status. Christine Blasey Ford is sworn in before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on Thursday, Sept. 27, 2018. (Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP) SEPT. 17, 2018 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., calls for an FBI background investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh. \"We need the FBI to step forward to ensure that the Senate and American public have complete information about this troubling alleged incident before a hearing is held,\u201d Schumer says. CNN calls the Ford accusation\u00a0a \"watershed moment for the GOP.\" The Huffington Post runs a story quoting Biden as saying, \"Women\u2019s Claims Of Sexual Assault Should Be Presumed To Be True.\" Biden remarks: \"For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you\u2019ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she\u2019s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it\u2019s been made worse or better over time. ... But nobody fails to understand that this is like jumping into a cauldron.\u201d Biden has previously said women should be presumptively\u00a0believed. HOW DOES EVIDENCE IN READE CASE COMPARE TO CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S CLAIMS? MARCH\u00a026, 2020 Jimmy Kimmel interviews Biden, and the two discuss\u00a0\"Where's Waldo?\" Kimmel does not ask Biden about Reade's accusation. Schumer, speaking on the Senate floor, touts a \"Green New Deal.\"\u00a0He accuses Republicans of \"refusing to admit\" that \"climate change is real.\" CNN teases an upcoming CNN town hall with Joe Biden. The Reade accusations\u00a0are\u00a0not discussed on-air in the network's preview coverage. SEPT. 18, 2018 Kavanaugh's nomination officially \"descends into chaos,\" CNN reports. The New York Times publishes an op-ed from Anita Hill, who argues: \"With the current heightened awareness of sexual violence comes heightened accountability for our representatives.\" Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii,\u00a0tells all men to \"shut up\"\u00a0-- and suggests Kavanaugh doesn't deserve due process because of rulings that she perceives as pro-life. MARCH\u00a027, 2020 CNN's Anderson Cooper does not ask Biden about Reade's claims in a lengthy virtual town hall. In its writeup of the event, CNN assures readers, \"Joe Biden: He's just like the rest of us.\" \"We sit on our back porch and they sit out on the lawn with two chairs,\" the network says of Biden and his wife Jill. \"They talk through everything that's happened during their day now that they are home from school, who's driving who crazy.\" The Huffington Post covers Reade's claim. The outlet notes, \"Last April, Reade was one of eight women to accuse the former vice president of inappropriate touching.\" The articles goes on to observe, however, that when she first accused Biden of inappropriate touching, Reade was \"accused of\u00a0being politically motivated and called a Russian operative after a Medium post in which she praised Russia and its president Vladimir Putin resurfaced.\" Reade has said she did not initially outline the full extent of Biden's alleged sexual assault, including digital penetration, out of embarrassment. SEPT. 19, 2018 The Guardian reports that Christine Ford's life has been \"turned upside down\" by her accusation, noting that she has received threats. The paper does not note that Kavanaugh and his family, as well as Republican senators,\u00a0also had received threats to their lives. MARCH\u00a028, 2020 The Guardian laments: \"It\u00a0hugely frustrating to see conservatives, who couldn\u2019t give a damn about the multiple sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump, weaponize the accusations against Biden. However, it\u2019s also frustrating to see so many liberals turning a blind eye. The accusations against the former vice-president are serious; why aren\u2019t they being taken seriously?\" LGBT supporters gather in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019, in Washington. The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in its first cases on LGBT rights since the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy was a voice for gay rights while his successor, Brett Kavanaugh, is regarded as more conservative. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) NYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' AFTER\u00a02020 DEMS USE STORY TO CALL FOR IMPEACHMENT\u00a0-- NOW PAPER NOTES THE SUPPOSED ACCUSER DOESN'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT SEPT. 27, 2018 CNN's Chris Cuomo asks a guest if Kavanaugh was known as a virgin at Yale University.\u00a0When the guest, a former classmate of Kavanaugh, rebuffs the question, Cuomo explains that he felt it was relevant given Kavanaugh's claim that he was a virgin through\u00a0college. South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham erupts, accusing Democrats of orchestrating \"the most unethical sham since I\u2019ve been in politics.\" \u201cWhat you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020,\u201d Graham says, before turning to Kavanaugh. \"Are you a gang rapist?\" Graham\u00a0asks\u00a0sarcastically, referring to an unsubstantiated accusation by Michael Avenatti client Julie Swetnick. The New York Times describes Kavanaugh and Graham's behavior as a typical display of \"white male anger.\" (Guy Benson, a Townhall.com political editor and Fox News contributor, tweeted this week that a \"non-conservative\" contact in the media had messaged\u00a0him to belatedly praise Graham's comments. \"I thought he was a loon\" to say the Kavanaugh hearings were all about power, the source said. \"In reality he was right all along.\") APRIL 5, 2020 A self-described movie enthusiast posts a transcript of Reade's claims on a message board. CNN and The New York Times have not yet mentioned Reade's story. Alyssa Milano suddenly embraces due process. OCT. 1, 2018 The New York Times embarks on\u00a0a deep dive, reporting that Kavanaugh was once questioned by police after a bar fight in 1985. A police report even said Kavanaugh \"threw ice at another patron.\" Meanwhile, the\u00a0ex-boyfriend of Julie Swetnick, the\u00a0third woman to make uncorroborated, lurid allegations\u00a0of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh, tells Fox News exclusively that she had threatened to kill his unborn child and at times even bizarrely asked him to hit her. \"Right after I broke up with her, she basically called me many times and at one point she basically said, 'You will never, ever see your unborn child alive,'\" Richard Vinneccy says\u00a0on \"The Ingraham Angle.\" According to Vinneccy, Swetnick told him at the time, 'I'm just going to go over there and kill you guys.'\" APRIL 9, 2020 Reade files a criminal complaint with the Washington, D.C. police, alleging that she was sexually assaulted in 1993. OCT. 3, 2018 It is widely reported that Leland Keyser, Ford's lifelong friend and a supposed witness at the party in which Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted Ford, doesn't back Ford's account.\u00a0Later, Keyser would say that much of Ford's account didn't make \"any sense,\" including how Ford couldn't remember how she got home from the party. Keyser would also say she was pressured by Ford associates at the time to change her story to corroborate Ford's account. \u201cI was told behind the scenes that certain things could be spread about me if I didn\u2019t comply,\u201d Keyser told The New York Times. \u201cI don\u2019t have any confidence in the story.\" With Keyser's statement, it becomes clear that no one can contemporaneously\u00a0corrobotate Ford's story. Meanwhile, protesters let out a collective \"STOP KAVANAUGH\" scream at a protest in Brooklyn. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, assures demonstrators in Washington: \"This isn\u2019t about politics or anything else.\" A Democratic aide is arrested, and would later be convicted, in a scheme to dox Republican lawmakers\u00a0who support Kavanaugh by revealing their personal information online. APRIL 12, 2020 The Times\u00a0covers\u00a0Reade's accusations, and makes sure to note that Reade could face criminal penalties if she filed a false police report.\u00a0Attempting to explain why the Times waited so much longer to report on Reade's accusation, Times executive editor Dean Baquet\u00a0claims\u00a0that \"Kavanaugh was already in a public forum in a large way\" -- although he does not explain why that logic did not apply to Biden, who was sealing up the Democratic Party's nomination for president when Reade went public with her claim. The Times piece\u00a0focuses on unrelated sexual misconduct accusations against President Trump, and largely dismisses Reade's allegations as uncorroborated by her co-workers -- even though the Times notes later in its piece that Reade's claim was contemporaneously corroborated by two of Reade's friends. Baquet would also\u00a0admit\u00a0the story was edited after publication at the request of the Biden campaign to remove a reference to Biden's past history of inappropriate touching, including many photographs and even video showing Biden touching women and making them visibly uncomfortable. No notation in the story indicates that it was edited. According to a\u00a0copy of the Times' article\u00a0saved by the Internet archive Wayback Machine, the Times originally reported: \"No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade\u2019s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.\" After the Biden campaign's request, the paragraph\u00a0now reads: \"No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade\u2019s allegation.\u00a0The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden.\" \"Another good day not to be the NYT public editor,\" muses the paper's former public editor, Margaret Sullivan. Later in the day, The Washington Post also covers Reade's claims for the first time. Both the Post and the Times mention accusations against President Trump. Actress-turned-activist\u00a0Rose McGowan\u00a0quickly slams\u00a0the\u00a0Washington Post, saying its article was \u201cnot journalism\u201d and constituted \u201cvictim shaming.\u201d ABC and CBS News, among other networks, mention Reade's claims shortly afterward, also for the first time. OCT. 6, 2018 Anti-Kavanaugh\u00a0protesters bang on the walls of the Supreme Court to protest his confirmation. APRIL 15, 2020 The Washington Post openly struggles with Reade's claims: \"What to make of former Joe Biden staffer\u00a0Tara Reade\u2019s allegations\u00a0that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee sexually assaulted her in 1993?\" writes\u00a0the paper's deputy editorial page editor, Ruth Marcus.\u00a0\"This is a difficult and important question \u2014 not least for those who were persuaded by\u00a0Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s assertion\u00a0that then-Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh assaulted her when they were high school students in the 1980s.\" Marcus goes on to admit that \"we all suffer from the inclination, whether knowing or unknowing, to assess evidence through the lens of preexisting biases.\" CNN, two days later, notes that Democrats were \"grappling\" with the Biden accusations -- a common framing\u00a0seemingly employed by left-of-center outlets to avoid directly discussing the allegations. OCT. 15, 2018 The Guardian reports that witches are planning to hex Kavanaugh. APRIL 24, 2020 A resurfaced clip of \"Larry King Live\" from 1993 appears to include the mother of\u00a0Tara Reade --\u00a0who has accused Joe Biden of past sexual assault while in the Senate\u00a0--\u00a0alluding to \u201cproblems\u201d her daughter faced while working as a staffer for the then-U.S. senator from Delaware. But rather than CNN's team of investigative reporters, it was\u00a0the Media Research Center\u2019s NewsBusters, a conservative group that seeks to expose liberal bias, that exhumed the footage from its own vault. NewsBusters found the clip after The Intercept first reported on a transcript of the Larry King interview. \"I\u2019m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington?\" the caller begins. \"My daughter has just left there, after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through with her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him.\" In a telephone interview with Fox News,\u00a0Reade confirms\u00a0that her mother called in to the show --\u00a0and it is independently confirmed that the caller in the show had phoned in from the same California city where Reade's mother lived at the time.\u00a0Biden's presidential campaign has adamantly denied\u00a0Reade's allegations but the video could be cited as evidence supporting Reade\u2019s allegation \u2013 even though her late mother, in the clip, does not specifically refer to a sexual assault claim. CNN would not cover the clip until the following afternoon, well after most other media organizations. The Intercept had\u00a0reported earlier\u00a0that Reade said her late mother once called into\u00a0CNN\u2019s \u201cLarry King Live\u201d\u00a0to discuss her daughter\u2019s \u201cexperience on Capitol Hill,\u201d where the alleged encounter with Biden took place. Reade didn\u2019t recall other information, such as the date or even year, and The Intercept managed to dig up a transcript of the call\u00a0but not the video. Meanwhile, aides to former 2020 hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders express their anger. \"The video of Tara Reade's late mother calling into Larry King to blow the whistle about about [sic] Tara's sexual assault is being met with relative silence from a cadre of progressives right now and I want you all to know that I see you,\" former Sanders senior adviser Winnie Wong tweets.\u00a0\"We all do.\" \"Progressives didn't make this happen.\u00a0Corporate Democrats chose Biden,\"\u00a0Briahna Joy Gray, former Sanders press secretary, tweets.\u00a0 Gray also added: \"It's a good time to note that Bernie's on the ballot.\" Shortly afterward, ex-Clinton adviser Peter Daou says Biden should withdraw his candidacy. He writes: \"If #MeToo means anything, it CANNOT BE APPLIED ON A PARTISAN BASIS.\" OCT. 17, 2018 The Washington Post speculates\u00a0about \"two ways Democrats can remove Kavanaugh -- without impeaching him.\" One of the approaches: A\u00a0new president could \"nominate and the Senate would confirm by majority vote a justice \u2014 in this case Kavanaugh \u2014 to a different post on an intermediate court of appeals (say the D.C. Circuit, where Kavanaugh formerly served). The justice would, in effect, be demoted.\" The Post notes with regret that the move is \"admittedly unprecedented at the Supreme Court level.\" Another equally unprecedented\u00a0but \"optimal\" option:\u00a0the\u00a0\"creation of a new vehicle for judicial peer review ... [that would]\u00a0create a nonpartisan, procedurally robust device for disciplining judges.\" \"If the political stars align, something good for our constitutional democracy might result from their efforts: a better way to discipline errant federal judges,\" opines the piece's since-disappointed author, University of Chicago law professor\u00a0Aziz Huq. APRIL 26, 2020 The 1993 episode of CNN's \"Larry King Live\"\u00a0apparently featuring Reade's mother is discovered missing from the Google Play store. But, CNN's head of strategic communications, Matt Dornic, responds: \"This is B.S. CNN didn\u2019t remove anything. We do not have a distro deal for LKL w/ Google Play. Listings on the site are not sourced thru CNN. Click any episode, it will say \u201cnot available to watch.\u201d True for\u00a0@foxnews \u00a0programs too. I\u2019ll wait 4 ur correction & apology.\" Meanwhile, Biden and his surrogates are not asked about Reade's claims on any of the Sunday political shows. The next day, Business Insider exclusively reports additional contemporaneous corroboration of Reade's claims -- in depth and on-the-record\u00a0from Reade's\u00a0former next-door neighbor.

CNN overhauled a story on its website Wednesday after being widely accused of publishing \"Chinese propaganda\" in a report that originally cited a media outlet controlled by the Chinese government,\u00a0but the change has been labeled by some as \"disingenuous.\" On Monday, CNN.com\u00a0ran an article about China People's Liberation Army (PLA) supposedly having a foothold in the spread of the coronavirus in a branch of its military. CNN\u2019s original headline was, \u201cChina's PLA Navy is controlling coronavirus and aircraft carrier's deployment proves it, report says.\u201d CNN ACCUSED OF 'LITERALLY PUBLISHING CHINESE PROPAGANDA' The story was widely criticized and sparked an outrage on social media with everyone from Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and Sen. Josh Hawley to members of the mainstream media condemning the article. CNN changed a story on its website Wednesday after being widely accused of originally publishing \"Chinese propaganda.\" \"I'm horrified that CNN published this. Its literally a Chinese propaganda story,\" Washington Post columnist Isaac Stone Fish reacted. Following the intense backlash, CNN changed the headline and edited the story to make it appear somewhat skeptical of China's claims. The\u00a0new headline is:\u00a0\u201cChinese state media claims country's navy is not affected by coronavirus.\u201d CNN MISSING IN ACTION ON BIDEN ASSAULT ACCUSER TARA READE'S STORY The original version of the story, written by CNN\u2019s Brad Lendon, praised the Chinese military\u2019s response to coronavirus while noting that multiple U.S. Navy aircraft carriers have reported cases of coronavirus. \"A Chinese naval flotilla headed into the Pacific over the weekend, evidence that the People's Liberation Army Navy has done a much better job controlling coronavirus\u00a0than the US Navy, according to a story posted on the PLA's English-language website,\" the original article, which can still be seen via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, began. The CNN article\u2019s new lead -- and much of the entire article -- are\u00a0quite different. \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, has spread to more than 180 countries and sickened close to 2 million people, including more than 80,000 in China. Yet according to the Chinese government,\u00a0not a single serving member of the country's military has been infected,\u201d the updated version of the article begins.

The\u00a0New York Times stealth-edited its article\u00a0on the sexual-assault allegation against Joe Biden by his former Senate staffer Tara Reade just minutes after it was published\u00a0on Sunday morning, removing all references in a key paragraph\u00a0to the multiple past accusations by seven women that the former vice president had touched them inappropriately. The Times piece also\u00a0focuses on unrelated sexual misconduct accusations against President Trump, and largely dismisses Reade's allegations as uncorroborated by her co-workers -- even though the Times notes later in its piece that Reade's claim was contemporaneously corroborated by two of Reade's friends. According to a copy of the Times' article saved by the Internet archive Wayback Machine, the Times originally reported: \"No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade\u2019s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.\" That paragraph now reads: \"No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade\u2019s allegation.\u00a0The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden.\" On Monday, the Times' executive editor, Dean Baquet,\u00a0admitted that the Biden campaign had requested the change. Baquet also offered little explanation as to why the Times had waited nearly two weeks to publicize Reade's accusation, while it posted a claim by a woman who accused Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh of misconduct within hours. The Times' handling of Reade's accusations, conservative commentators and some Democrats said, stood in stark contrast to how the media and several senators handled accusations about Kavanaugh. Reade filed a report with Washington, D.C., police on Thursday concerning her allegation that Biden penetrated her without consent in 1993. Fox News has confirmed with the District\u2019s police department that she filed the criminal complaint, which does not reference Biden by name. The Biden campaign has strongly denied Reade's accusation, although the former vice president has previously acknowledged that he should change his behavior around women. The Times' piece contained other references to the several\u00a0women who have said Biden touched them in inappropriate ways, but deleted any mention of them in the section of its article that asserted that Biden had no \"pattern\" of misconduct. The Times offered no explanation for the stealth-edit on its website, nor did it respond to Fox News' request for comment. The paper made a similar late edit\u00a0last September, when it updated a story about a newly resurfaced\u00a0accusation against\u00a0Kavanaugh to note that the supposed accuser didn't remember the alleged assault. The update came after virtually all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates cited the story to call for impeaching Kavanaugh. The Times' editorial guidlines\u00a0call for editors' notes \"generally to acknowledge a journalistic lapse other than a factual error.\" On Twitter, at 11:54 a.m. ET on Sunday,\u00a0the Times tweeted: \"We've deleted a tweet in this thread that had some imprecise language that has been changed in the story.\" The paper had initially begun tweeting excerpts from the published article at 5:39 a.m. ET, including the sentence about Biden's \"hugs, kisses, and touching.\" Additionally, the Times buried a reference to the story in its morning email to readers, after a section on Bernie Sanders withdrawing from the presidential race several paragraphs deep into the email. Both the Times' original article and the updated\u00a0version generated swift backlash. \"The@nytimes \u00a0deleted this tweet and also did an unacknowledged edit of this out of their story. Brave,\" wrote Jeremy Scahill, the co-founder of The Intercept.\u00a0\"What would the correction even say? \u201cAn earlier version of this story contained a true statement that the Biden campaign demanded we remove so we cut it without alerting our readers.\u201d Something like that?\" NYT STEALTH-EDITS KAVANAUGH BOMBSHELL AFTER 2020 DEMS USE IT TO CALL FOR IMPEACHMENT \"I\u2019m not sure how that line from the NYT\u2019s long-delayed coverage of Tara Reade\u2019s accusation can sit alongside reporting that 7 other women have accused Biden of sexual misconduct,\"\u00a0wrote Bernie Sanders' national press secretary Briahna Joy Gray. She also noted that Sanders had \"graciously\" not mentioned Biden's\u00a0\"credible sexual assault allegations,\" \"pattern of unwanted touching,\" involvement with Burisma Holdings, or \"lying [about his]\u00a0civil rights record.\" Added journalist Glenn Greenwald: \"Do you think people won't notice that liberal institutions and media outlets spent months maligning Brett Kavanaugh's defenders as misogynistic rape apologists, only to now invoke all their arguments to defend Joe Biden & demean Tara Reade? Do you think people are that dumb?\" FILE - In this Sept. 9, 2012 file photo, then-Vice President Joe Biden talks to customers, including a woman who pulled up her chair in front of the bench Biden was sitting on, during a stop at Cruisers Diner in Seaman, Ohio. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) \"New York Times absolutely knows what they are doing is biased & corrupt because of how they treated Kavanaugh, and they also know they can stand there with sh--\u00a0eating smiles about it because no other journalists will say sh--\u00a0about it,\" wrote commentator Stephen Miller. Prior to the Times' updated edit, Miller sarcastically called the Times' original paragraph \"art.\" \"What the $#@!,\u00a0@nytimes?\" asked commentator Josh Jordan. \"Not to repeat myself, but this isn't about the Tara Reade accusations, but Biden's (and the NYT's) hypocrisy,\" added lawyer Scott Greenfield.\u00a0\"Either it's due process for all or none. Biden doesn't get a pass.\" In its piece on Reade's accusations, the Times goes on to warn that \"fling a false police report\u00a0may be punishable by a fine and imprisonment.\" BIDEN SITS FOR ANOTHER TV INTERVIEW -- AND ISN'T ASKED ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT ACCUSATION By\u00a0contrast, the Times, in 2018, was largely sympathetic to Kavanaugh's\u00a0accusers, even publishing an article titled, \"For Christine Blasey Ford, a Drastic Turn From a Quiet Life in Academia.\"\u00a0 Ford's\u00a0close lifelong friend, Leland Keyser, who Ford said had attended the party where Kavanaugh\u00a0allegedly assaulted her, has told reporters\u00a0she\u00a0did not believe Ford's story\u00a0and felt pressured to lie about it. Then-Vice President Joe Biden leans in to say something to Maggie Coons, next to her father Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., after Biden administered the Senate oath to Coons during a ceremonial re-enactment swearing-in ceremony, Jan. 6, 2015, in the Old Senate Chamber of Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) \u201cI don\u2019t have any confidence in the story,\u201d Keyser said. \"Those facts together I don't recollect, and it just didn't make any sense,\" she added,\u00a0referring to Ford's explanation of how she was assaulted at a party that Keyser attended, but could not recall how she got home. And, in a \"News Analysis,\" the Times wrote a sympathetic piece concerning Kavanaugh accuser Deborah Ramirez:\u00a0\"Brett Kavanaugh Fit In With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not.\" (During that period, the Times also covered sexual harassment allegations against ex-CDC chief Dr. Tom Frieden, a Democrat,\u00a0and former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, also a Democrat.) Democrats similarly took a far more aggressive approach during the Kavanaugh episode. Sen. Mazie Horono, D-Hawaii, for example, likened the confirmation process to a \"job interview,\" and said a lower standard of proof applied to accusations of misconduct. Hirono also cited Kavanaugh's legal \"philosophy\" as a reason to suspect his guilt. In its piece on Sunday, the Times notes that Reade was \"hired in December 1992 and paid by Mr. Biden\u2019s office until August 1993\" -- in contrast to several of Kavanaugh's accusers, including\u00a0Ford, who presented no definitive evidence that they had ever met the judge. Early\u00a0in the article, the Times asserted that \"no\u00a0former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade\u2019s allegation.\" But several paragraphs later, the paper noted that a slew of other women, including some who had experience with Biden, did find the accusations credible. ROSE MCGOWAN HITS 'FRAUD' ALYSSA MILANO AFTER SHE BACKS BIDEN \"A friend said that Ms. Reade told her about the alleged assault at the time, in 1993,\" the Times wrote.\u00a0\"A second friend recalled Ms. Reade telling her in 2008 that Mr. Biden had touched her inappropriately and that she\u2019d had a traumatic experience while working in his office.\" Concerning that paragraph, Townhall political editor and Fox News contributor Guy Benson observed: \"I don't know whether Ms. Reade is telling the truth, and the presumption of innocence is a vital pillar of our justice system.\u00a0\u00a0But this detail alone presents more contemporaneous evidence against Biden than was ever\u00a0\u00a0presented against Kavanaugh:\" \"The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.\" \"Now consider how these two cases have been treated by the media,\" Benson said.\u00a0\"There is nothing even approaching a consistent standard here. The bias is just right out there in the open, for all to see. Utterly undeniable.\" LAST YEAR: ACCUSATIONS OF IMPROPER TOUCHING MOUNT AGAINST BIDEN In its piece, the Times conceded that \"[t]he seven other women who had complained about Mr. Biden told the Times this month that they did not have any new information about their experiences to add, but several said they believed Ms. Reade\u2019s account.\" But the paper then quickly pivoted to President Trump. Nov. 1, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden with actress Eva Longoria in Las Vegas. \"President Trump has been accused of\u00a0sexual\u00a0assault\u00a0and\u00a0misconduct\u00a0by more than a dozen women, who have described a\u00a0pattern of behavior\u00a0that went\u00a0far beyond\u00a0the accusations against Mr. Biden,\" the paper wrote. Observed Reason's Robby Soave: \"New York Times story about Tara Reade\u2019s sexual assault allegation against Biden is harsher toward Trump.\" Biden, who has\u00a0previously said\u00a0that women leveling misconduct accusations should be presumptively believed, has largely gone unchallenged by the media concerning Reade's claim. Biden has acknowledged that he needs to change his behavior towards women, saying, \"I get it.\" \u201cWomen have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims. We encourage them to do so, because these accusations are false,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager and communications director for the\u00a0Biden\u00a0campaign, said in a statement to Fox News in March, concerning Reade's claim. Reade has come forward before \u2014 last year, when multiple women emerged claiming inappropriate touching by Biden. Reade, at the time, claimed Biden put his hands on her shoulders and rubbed his fingers up and down her neck, but was unable to gain traction on her story aside from an\u00a0article in a local newspaper. But in late March, Reade\u00a0told a far more graphic\u00a0account, with different and more serious details, raising the allegation to the level of sexual assault. WIFE OF FMR DEFENSE SEC SAYS BIDEN PHOTO IS MISLEADING Reade\u2019s story first resurfaced in an article in\u00a0The Intercept. She\u00a0then was interviewed by podcast host Katie Halper. There, Reade claimed that in 1993, she was asked by a more senior member of Biden\u2019s staff to bring the then-senator his gym bag near the Capitol building, which led to the encounter in question. \u201cHe greeted me, he remembered my name, and then we were alone. It was the strangest thing,\u201d Reade told Halper. \u201cThere was no like, exchange really. He just had me up against the wall.\u201d Reade said that she was wearing \u201ca business skirt,\u201d but \u201cwasn\u2019t wearing stockings \u2014 it was a hot day.\u201d She continued: \u201cHis hands were on me and underneath my clothes, and he went down my skirt and then up inside it and he penetrated me with his fingers and he was kissing me at the same time and he was saying some things to me.\u201d Reade claimed Biden first asked if she wanted \u201cto go somewhere else.\u201d \u201cI pulled away, he got finished doing what he was doing,\u201d Reade said. \u201cHe said: \u2018Come on, man.\u00a0I heard you liked me.\u2019\u201d HUNTER BIDEN SCANDALS EXPLAINED: UKRAINE, COCAINE, AND MORE She said she felt that\u00a0\u201ceverything shattered in that moment.\u201d Reade went on to allege that Biden looked at her and said \u201cyou\u2019re nothing to me.\u201d Reade said she attempted to share her story last year, but no one listened to her. She added: \u201cIf people want to know why women don\u2019t come forward, that\u2019s a good example of why.\u201d Fox News' Brooke Singman and Adam Shaw contributed to this report.

Fox News contributor and attorney Andrew McCarthy says the 'Washington playbook' prefers to do FISA court reforms instead of proper investigations. The FBI's Crossfire Hurricane team investigating the\u00a0Trump 2016 campaign\u00a0received multiple indications\u00a0that former British spy Christopher Steele --\u00a0one of their key informants in their investigation\u00a0-- was part of an elaborate \"Russian disinformation campaign,\" according to several newly declassified footnotes from Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report on FBI misconduct. The FBI\u00a0heavily relied on Steele's now-discredited dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant to spy on former Donald Trump aide Carter Page, in which FBI officials asserted that\u00a0Page was an \"agent\" of Russia. However, the FBI\u00a0did not share the information about the Russian disinformation campaign with the\u00a0Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) when it moved to obtain the warrant, just as it did not tell the court that another Trump aide had denied collusion during a recorded conversation with an FBI informant. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that the Russian collusion narrative was fatally flawed because of Russian disinformation,\" Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who had pushed for the declassification, said in a statement to Fox News on Friday. \"These footnotes confirm that there was a direct Russian disinformation campaign in 2016, and there were ties between Russian intelligence and a presidential campaign \u2013 the Clinton campaign, not Trump\u2019s.\u201d At the same time, Grassley's office added that \"the\u00a0senators expect a fuller declassification in the coming days,\" including a version of the footnotes that does not redact the names of those who raised the alarm about Steele. Some in Grassley's office, including Grassley himself, have seen the fully declassified footnotes, and want them publicly released immediately, Fox News is told. One of the footnotes, which was previously redacted in its entirety, read:\u00a0\u201cThe [REDACTED] stated that it did not have high confidence in this subset of Steele\u2019s reporting and assessed that the referenced subset was part of a Russian disinformation campaign to denigrate US foreign relations.\" That subset referred to the activities of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, whom Steele's dossier claimed had traveled to Prague to meet with Russian agents. Special Counsel Robert Mueller was unable to substantiate that claim, and Cohen has denied it. The footnote goes on to state that a 2017 report\u00a0\u201ccontained information \u2026 that the public reporting about the details of Trump\u2019s [REDACTED] activities in Moscow during a trip in 2013 were false, and that they\u00a0were the product of RIS\u00a0\u2018infiltra[ing] a source into the network\u2019 of a [REDACTED] who compiled a dossier of information on Trump\u2019s activities.\u201d Another footnote stated:\u00a0\"According to a document circulated among Crossfire Hurricane team members and supervisors in early October 2016, Person 1[Sergei Millian]\u00a0had historical contact with persons and entities suspected of being linked to RIS [Russian intelligence].\u00a0The document described reporting [REDACTED] that Person 1 'was rumored to be a former KGB/SVR officer.'\u00a0In addition, in late December 2016, Department Attorney Bruce Ohr told SSA 1 [FBI Agent Joe Pietnka]\u00a0that he had met with Glenn Simpson and that Simpson had assessed that Person 1 was a RIS officer who was central in connecting Trump to Russia.\" WHO IS MYSTERY FBI AGENT JOE PIENTKA, KEY PLAYER IN PAGE FISA? Pientka\u00a0was conspicuously\u00a0removed from the FBI's website\u00a0after Fox News contacted the FBI about his extensive\u00a0role in Crossfire Hurricane FISA matters, but sources say he remains in the agency's field office in San Francisco in a senior role. Republicans have sought to question him repeatedly. Millian contacted Fox News after this article was published, and strongly denied any links to illicit activities or intelligence services, saying there was an attempt to \"frame\" him that had backfired. The\u00a0newly released footnotes gave other reasons to doubt\u00a0the knowledge and credibility\u00a0of Steele's main sources, as well as the accuracy of Horowitz's own report. \"When interviewed by the FBI, the Primary Sub-source stated that he/she did not view his/her contacts as a network of sources, [REDACTED] with whom he/she has conversations about current events and government relations,\" one of the previously hidden footnotes reads. That statement directly\u00a0contradicted the executive summary of Horowitz's IG report, which asserted that Steele's Primary Sub-source \"used his/her network of sub-sources to gather information that was then passed to Steele.\" While Friday's disclosure was significant, the\u00a0partial declassification of the footnotes didn't fully comply with previous requests to the DOJ from Grassley and Johnson, whose\u00a0letter to Barr\u00a0sought the full and complete declassification of the four footnotes in the IG report in January. Grassley and Johnson wanted the DOJ to declassify footnotes 302, 334, 342 and 350; all were only partially unredacted, and 342 remains fully redacted. The fully redacted footnote\u00a0\"refers to information received by a member of the Crossfire Hurricane team regarding possible previous attempts by a foreign government to penetrate and research a company or indiviudals associated with Christopher Steele,\" the DOJ said, adding\u00a0that it would continue to\u00a0\"review\" the footnote's\u00a0classification for possible release. It was unclear which foreign government was implicated; the DOJ IG report refers to Russia numerous times without any redaction. In a letter to Barr in January seeking the full declassification of four footnotes in Horowitz's report,\u00a0Grassley and Johnson had written: \"We are concerned that certain sections of the public version of the [IG] report are misleading because they are contradicted by relevant and probative classified information redacted in four footnotes within the classified report.\" Friday's partial declassification, which suggested Steele's sources were part of a Russian interference effort, was immediately highlighted by Trump allies and Republicans, who have long pushed the administration to publicize more details of the FBI's flawed investigation, even as U.S. Attorney John Durham is pursuing a criminal\u00a0probe into the conduct of U.S. intelligence agencies. Former British spy Christopher Steele sat for a four-hour videotaped deposition last month. The\u00a0FBI's legal counsel later\u00a0described the warrant to surveil Page as \"essentially a single source FISA\" wholly dependent on the dossier, which also made numerous other unsubstantiated claims about Russian hackers in a nonexistent consulate in Miami, Cohen's purported trips to Prague, and lurid blackmail tapes. Aspects of the Page FISA that did not rely on the dossier have not fared well, either. For example, The Washington Post ended up in the Page FISA application as a key source alongside the dossier. A 2016\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0by the Post's Josh Rogin entitled,\u00a0\"Trump campaign guts GOP\u2019s anti-Russia stance on Ukraine,\"\u00a0had\u00a0overstated\u00a0developments at\u00a0the Republican National Convention in 2016. A single delegate had proposed a sweeping amendment to change the GOP platform to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine, in a major shift from the Obama administration's policy; parts of that amendment were rejected. But, the Post's opinion piece framed the development as nefarious, and a possible smoking gun. In a Page FISA application, the FBI\u00a0went on to cite Rogin's article word-for-word\u00a0\u2013\u00a0without quotation marks, but with a footnoted citation \u2013\u00a0as evidence that the Trump campaign could be working with the Russians in an illicit manner. The FBI apparently did not obtain independent verification\u00a0of the article\u2019s claims. \"The 'central and essential'\u00a0evidence used to justify invasive surveillance of an American citizen in the FBI\u2019s probe into Russian interference was, itself, an example of Russian interference, according to once-secret footnotes declassified at the urging of two U.S. Senators,\" Grassley's office said in a statement to Fox News on Friday. FBI SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED KEY FISA RULES -- CONTRADICTING MEDIA, DEMS \"For years, the public was fed a healthy diet of leaks, innuendo and false information to imply that President Trump and his campaign were part of a Russian conspiracy to spread disinformation,\" Grassley and Johnson said separately. \"The FBI\u2019s blind pursuit of the investigation, despite exculpatory and contradictory information, only legitimized the narrative. The mounting evidence undercutting this narrative should have stopped the investigation early in its tracks. Instead, it took several years and millions in taxpayer dollars to conclude that the allegations were baseless.\" The senators continued: \u201cHad FBI leadership heeded the numerous warnings of Russian disinformation, paid attention to the glaring contradictions in the pool of evidence and followed long-standing procedures to ensure accuracy, everyone would have been better off. Carter Page\u2019s civil liberties wouldn\u2019t have been shredded, taxpayer dollars wouldn\u2019t have been wasted, the country wouldn\u2019t be as divided and the FBI\u2019s reputation wouldn\u2019t be in shambles. Sen. Chuck Grassley, along with Ron. Johnson, R-Wisc., pushed for the release of the footnotes. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) The Justice Department IG, Michael Horowitz, has found that the FBI systematically violated\u00a0rules designed to protect Americans from unauthorized surveillance, including Page,\u00a0prompting the FISC to rebuke the FBI and demand changes. \u201cWhy have all these details remained unnecessarily secret for so long?\" Page asked Fox News on Friday. \"In our dual system of Justice, the Mueller Witch Hunt crew falsely misrepresented my own 'historical contact with persons and entities suspected of being linked to RIS,' when I was actually serving my country in support of the U.S. Intelligence Community. The time has finally come for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and related agencies to release the full facts about the Obama-Biden Administration\u2019s election interference campaign against candidate Trump and the illicit coup attempt against our President.\u201d TRUMP AIDE DENIED COLLUSION TO FBI INFORMANT, BUT FBI DIDN'T TELL SECRET COURT: TRANSCRIPT In Page's case, an ex-FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, even falsified an email from the CIA to make Page's Russian contacts seem nefarious, when Page in fact had been an informant to the CIA about those contacts, according to Horowitz. It emerged separately on Thursday that an FBI confidential human source secretly recorded George\u00a0Papadopoulos\u00a0in the final days of the 2016 presidential election and pressed\u00a0him over whether the Trump campaign was involved in Russian election meddling --\u00a0something the campaign aide emphatically denied, according to a transcript of that conversation. Fox News obtained the\u00a0transcript\u00a0of the recording,\u00a0which spreads over 171\u00a0pages. Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, is referred to in the transcript as \"Crossfire Typhoon\" or \"CT.\" The recording covers a more than four-hour conversation\u00a0on Oct. 31, 2016.\u00a0According to the obtained transcripts, the confidential human source (CHS) met with Papadopoulos and asked whether he thought Russians hacked the Democratic National Committee (DNC) ahead of the Democratic National Convention. \u201cNo,\u201d Papadopoulos replied. DOJ'S RUSSIA PROBE REVIEW FOCUSING ON 'SMOKING GUN' TAPES OF MEETING WITH TRUMP AIDE: SOURCES The comments made by Papadopoulos are noteworthy because, according to officials, they were never provided or included in evidence to the FISC when seeking warrants to surveil Page over suspicion of Trump campaign ties to Russia. When asked whether he thought the Russians had \u201cspecial interests\u201d in the election, Papadopoulos replied: \u201cThat\u2019s all bullsh--. No one knows who\u2019s hacking them,\u201d and added that it \u201ccould be the Chinese, could be the Iranians, it could be some Bernie, uh supporters. Could be anonymous.\u201d Papadopoulos was then asked whether he thought Russians \u201chave interest in Trump.\u201d \u201cThey, dude, no one knows how a president\u2019s going to govern anyway. You don\u2019t just say, oh I like\u2014,\u201d he said before being cut off. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Even Putin said it himself. It\u2019s all, it\u2019s like conspiracy theories.\u201d The source went on to press Papadopoulos, saying: \u201cI feel like there\u2019s some heavy Trump supporters out there that kind of want to rig this f\u2014king election in Trump\u2019s favor and then at the same time, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Papadopoulos quipped: \u201cDude, you, you..there is no rigging in his favor.\u201d Durham's criminal probe concerning the FBI's Russia probe remains ongoing. Speaking to Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" on Thursday,\u00a0Barr said he has seen troubling signs from the investigation. Former FBI Director James Comey, left; U.S. Attorney John Durham, right. \"My own view is that the evidence shows that we're not dealing with just the mistakes or sloppiness,\" Barr told host Laura Ingraham. \"There was something far more troubling here. We're going to get to the bottom of it. And if people broke the law and we can establish that with the evidence, they will be prosecuted.\" BARR SAYS 'FAR MORE TROUBLING' EVIDENCE COMING FROM DURHAM PROBE It has emerged since former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's guilty plea that the FBI officials\u00a0who interviewed Flynn, anti-Trump agent\u00a0Peter Strzok\u00a0and \"SSA [Supervisory Special Agent] 1,\"\u00a0have each separately\u00a0been implicated\u00a0by Horowitz\u00a0in\u00a0apparent\u00a0misconduct and mismanagement\u00a0in both the Flynn case and the Carter Page matter. Strzok's\u00a0anti-Trump bias\u00a0is\u00a0well-documented. The identity of SSA 1\u00a0is protected in the Flynn legal proceedings by a court order, but Fox News\u00a0has reported that\u00a0documents point to\u00a0Joe Pientka,\u00a0who moved last year from the Washington, D.C., area to San Francisco. Pientka briefly\u00a0appeared on the FBI's website\u00a0as an \"Assistant Special Agent in Charge\" of the San Francisco field office late last year, according to the Internet archive\u00a0Wayback Machine. However, Pientka\u00a0no longer appears on any FBI website\u00a0after being removed shortly after\u00a0Fox News identified him\u00a0as the unnamed SSA\u00a0in the IG report; Fox News is told Pientka received a promotion to a senior role in the bureau's San Francisco field office. Pientka's extensive\u00a0role in handling the Page FISA has been outlined in Horowitz's report, and top Republican senators, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have requested that Pientka sit for an interview to explain himself. Fox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.

All rights reserved. Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes. Market data provided by Factset. Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Legal Statement. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.  Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe claims there is an 'inherent weakness' in the process the FBI uses to obtain warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. At least two of the FBI\u2019s surveillance applications to secretly monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page lacked probable cause, according to\u00a0a\u00a0newly declassified summary of a Justice Department assessment\u00a0released Thursday by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). The DOJ's admission\u00a0essentially means that\u00a0the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant authorizations to surveil Page, when stripped of the FBI's misinformation, did not meet the necessary legal threshold and should never have been issued. Democrats, including Rep. Adam Schiff, had previously insisted the Page FISA warrants met \"rigorous\" standards for probable cause, and mocked Republicans for suggesting otherwise. The June 2017 Page FISA warrant renewal, which was among the two deemed invalid by the DOJ, was approved by then-Acting FBI Director (and now CNN contributor) Andrew McCabe, as well as former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The April 2017 warrant renewal was approved by then-FBI Director James Comey. \u201cToday\u2019s unprecedented court filing represents another step on the road to recovery for America\u2019s deeply damaged judicial system,\" Page said in a statement to Fox News.\u00a0\"I hope that this latest admission of guilt for these civil rights abuses by the Justice Department marks continued progress towards restoring justice and remedying these reputationally ruinous injuries.\u201d Added Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, who previously chaired the Judiciary Committee: \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u00a0 It\u2019s about time federal authorities entrusted with our most powerful and intrusive surveillance tools begin to own up to their failures and abuses, and take steps to restore public confidence. ...\u00a0Time will tell if the department will continue working to fix its errors and restore trust that it won\u2019t disregard Americans\u2019 civil liberties. Its admission and cooperation with the FISC is a step in the right direction.\" FISC Presiding Judge\u00a0James Boasberg, in the Jan. 7 order that was published for the first time Thursday, further required the government to explain in a written statement by Jan. 28 the \"FBI's handling of information\" obtained through the Page warrants and subsequent renewals. READ THE DECLASSIFIED ORDER Boasberg specifically noted the DOJ found\u00a0\"there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause to believe that\u00a0Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power\" because of the \"material misstatements and omissions\" in the warrant applications. Then-FBI acting director Andrew McCabe, now a CNN contributor, approved one of the now-discredited FISA applications. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) Although the DOJ assessment technically only covered two of the applications to renew the Page FISA warrant, the DOJ \"apparently does not take a position on the validity\" on the first two Page FISA applications, Boasberg said, seemingly indicating that the DOJ seemingly did not want to defend their legality either. The government \"intends to sequester information acquired pursuant to those\" FISA applications\u00a0\"in the same manner as information acquired pursuant to the subsequent dockets,\" the judge said, possibly indicating that those applications are still under review. Boasberg noted that it is illegal for the government to\u00a0intentionally disclose or use \"information obtained under color of law by electronic surveillance, knowing or having any reason to know that the information was obtained through electronic surveillance not authorized.\" A lawful FISA warrant, when approved by the FISC, allows the FBI to surveil not only the target of the warrant,\u00a0but also individuals who communicate with the target and the target's associates. It was not clear what information, if any, the FBI gleaned from the Page FISA and then used in subsequent court arguments; any such evidence would likely be ruled inadmissible, given the DOJ's admission that the underlying warrants were invalid. The revelations Thursday were yet another embarrassment for the FBI, which DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz has found\u00a0made repeated errors and misrepresentations\u00a0-- and, in one case, deliberately\u00a0falsified evidence -- before the FISC as the bureau sought to surveil Page in 2016 and 2017. The FBI's\u00a0FISA applications to monitor Page heavily relied, Horowitz confirmed, on a now-discredited dossier funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), as well as on news reports that secretly relied on the dossier's author. Much of the\u00a0Steele dossier\u00a0has been proved\u00a0unsubstantiated, including the dossier's claims that the Trump campaign was paying hackers in the United States\u00a0out of a non-existent\u00a0Russian consulate in Miami, or that ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to conspire with Russians. Special Counsel Robert Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that\u00a0Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of\u00a0Rosneft, a Russian oil giant, or that a lurid blackmail tape involving the president existed. Pursuant to Boasberg's order, the government must also sequester relevant information\u00a0and provide further \"explanations\" concerning the damning findings of bureau misconduct contained in Horowitz's\u00a0recent report, as well as\u00a0\"related investigations and any litigation.\" FISC ORDERS FBI REVIEW OF PROCEDURES ... BUT LEAVES OUT SPECIAL AGENT PIENTKA, A LITTLE-KNOWN KEY PLAYER IN THE FISA SCANDAL That could be a reference to a variety of outstanding matters concerning the FBI's apparent mischaracterization of evidence before the FISC. For example, the FISC has already ordered the bureau to look at all previous FISA applications involving ex-FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith, whom Horowitz found to have doctored an email from the CIA. The FBI had reached out to the CIA and other intelligence agencies for information on Page; the\u00a0CIA responded in an email\u00a0by telling the FBI that Page had contacts with Russians from 2008 to 2013, but that Page had reported them to the CIA\u00a0and was serving as a CIA\u00a0operational contact and informant on Russian business and intelligence interests. Clinesmith then allegedly doctored the\u00a0CIA's email about Page\u00a0to make it seem as though the agency had said only that Page was not an active source. The FBI also included Page's contacts with Russians in the warrant application as evidence he was a foreign \"agent,\" without disclosing to the secret surveillance court that Page was voluntarily working with the CIA concerning those foreign contacts. \"Today\u2019s unprecedented court filing represents another step on the road to recovery for America\u2019s deeply damaged judicial system.\" Further, Horowitz found specific evidence of oversights and errors by several top FBI\u00a0employees\u00a0as they sought to obtain a warrant to surveil Page.\u00a0In particular, an unidentified\u00a0FBI supervisory special agent (SSA) mentioned in the IG report was responsible for ensuring that the\u00a0bureau's \"Woods Procedures\" were followed in the Page warrant application, but apparently didn't do so. According to the procedures, factual assertions need to be independently\u00a0verified, and information contradicting those assertions must be presented to the court. Horowitz found several instances in which the procedures were not followed. Horowitz's report\u00a0leaves little doubt\u00a0that the unnamed SSA is\u00a0Joe Pientka -- a current bureau employee. Pientka briefly\u00a0appeared on the FBI's website\u00a0as an \"Assistant Special Agent in Charge\" of the San Francisco field office late last year, according to the Internet archive\u00a0Wayback Machine\u00a0-- although Pientka\u00a0no longer appears on any FBI website. Pientka was removed shortly after Fox News identified him as the unnamed SSA in the IG report. Twitter user Techno Fog first flagged\u00a0the Wayback Machine's archive of the page. The FBI has repeatedly refused to respond to Fox News' request for clarification on Pientka's status, even as Republicans in Congress have sought to question him. While the FBI has promised corrective action, it apparently has not gone far enough. Earlier this month,\u00a0David Kris, who has been\u00a0appointed\u00a0by the FISC to oversee the FBI's proposed surveillance reforms,\u00a0alerted the court\u00a0that the bureau's proposals are \"insufficient\" and must be dramatically \"expanded\" -- even declaring that FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to discuss the importance of accuracy and transparency before the FISC every time he \"visits a field office in 2020.\" In December 2017, then-FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe testified that \u201cno surveillance warrant would have been sought\u201d from the FISA court \u201cwithout the Steele dossier information,\" according to a House GOP memo's findings. McCabe is now a CNN contributor. The unclassified\u00a0findings were a stark rebuke to Wray, who had\u00a0filed\u00a0assurances\u00a0to the FISC\u00a0that the agency was implementing new procedures and training programs to assure that the FBI presents accurate and thorough information when it seeks secret warrants from FISC judges. At the same time, Wray acknowledged the FBI's \"unacceptable\" failures as it pursued FISA warrants to monitor Page. Kris is a former Obama administration attorney who has\u00a0previously defended the FISA process\u00a0on \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" and in\u00a0other left-wing venues, making his rebuke of Wray\u00a0something of an unexpected redemptive moment for Republicans who have long called for more accountability in how the bureau obtains surveillance warrants. (\"You can\u2019t make this up!\" President Trump tweeted on Sunday. \"David Kris, a highly controversial former DOJ official, was just appointed by the FISA Court to oversee reforms to the FBI\u2019s surveillance procedures. Zero credibility. THE SWAMP!\u201d) WHAT EXACTLY DID KRIS TAKE ISSUE WITH IN THE FBI'S PROPOSED REFORMS? Wray had specifically promised\u00a0to change relevant forms to \"emphasize the need to err on the side of disclosure\" to the FISC, to create a new \"checklist\" to be completed \"during the drafting process\" for surveillance warrants that reminds agents to include \"relevant information\" about the bias of sources used, and to \"formalize\" the role of FBI lawyers in the legal review process of surveillance warrants. Additionally, Wray\u00a0said the FBI would now require \"agents and supervisors\" to confirm with the DOJ\u00a0Office of Intelligence that the DOJ has been advised of relevant information. Wray further indicated that the FBI would formalize requirements to \"reverify facts presented in prior FISA applications and make any necessary corrections,\" as well as to make unspecified \"technological improvements.\" But in\u00a0a\u00a015-page letter\u00a0to Judge Boasberg,\u00a0obtained by Fox News, Kris declared that the\u00a0proposed corrective actions \"do not go far enough to provide the Court with the necessary assurance of accuracy, and therefore must be expanded and improved\" -- and he took aim at Wray himself. \"The focus on specific forms, checklists\u00a0and technology, while appropriate, should not be allowed to eclipse the more basic need to improve cooperation between the FBI and DOJ attorneys,\" Kris said, noting that the FBI and DOJ have historically not always worked well together. \"A key method of improving organizational culture is through improved tone at the top, particularly in a hierarchical organization such as the FBI,\" Kris said, noting that Wray's public statements on the matter, while positive, have not gone far enough. \"Director Wray and other FBI leaders, as well as relevant leaders at the Department of Justice, should include discussions of compliance not only in one or two messages, but in virtually every significant communication with the workforce for the foreseeable future.\" Republican calls for more accountability may not go unanswered for long. Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham\u00a0announced last year\u00a0that he did not \"agree\"\u00a0with the IG's assessment that the FBI's probes were properly predicated, highlighting Durham's broader criminal mandate and scope of review. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Durham is\u00a0focusing on foreign actors, as well as the CIA, while Horowitz concentrated his attention on the Justice Department and FBI. \"Based on the evidence collected to date, and while our investigation is ongoing, last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report\u2019s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened,\" Durham said in his statement, adding that his \"investigation is not limited to developing information from within component parts of the Justice Department\" and \"has\u00a0included developing information from other persons and entities, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.\" Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

In December 2017, Mediaite discovered a trove of anti-gay articles written by Reid from 2007-2009 on a political blog called \u201cThe Reid Report\u201d years before she was hired by MSNBC. At the time, Reid issued an apology, calling her remarks \u201cinsensitive, tone deaf and dumb\u201d and vowed to \u201cdo better\u201d going forward. However, after Mediaite found even more homophobic articles in April 2018, Reid claimed that an \u201cunknown, external party accessed and manipulated material\u201d on her old blog and \u201cfabricated\u201d the offensive entries and that she was working with a \u201ccyber-security expert\u201d and \u201cnotified federal law enforcement officials.\u201d Days later, Reid\u2019s attorney John H. Reichman confirmed that the FBI had \u201copened an investigation into potential criminal activities surrounding several online accounts, including personal email and blog accounts\u201d belonging to the MSNBC host. JOY REID THREATENED COLLEAGUE WITH VIOLENCE, EX-BOSSES SAY Upon scrutiny, skeptics have said\u00a0Reid\u2019s claims don\u2019t pass muster. The Daily Beast, which\u00a0had suspended Reid as a contributor, conducted its own investigation and concluded that claims made by Reid\u2019s cyber-security expert Jonathan Nichols that \u201cscreenshot manipulation\u201d took place were false. Critics have pointed to the Internet archival service The Wayback Machine, which showed that the anti-gay articles were preserved at the time they were written and refuted the suggestion that hackers could have manipulated their archives. Reid addressed the controversy the following week on her show. Although she did offer an apology, she did not take ownership of her blog posts like she did in her first apology, telling her viewers, \u201cI genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things because they are completely alien to me.\u201d Many of her MSNBC colleagues expressed their support for her at the time. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Washington Free Beacon\u2019s Alex Griswold commemorated the one-year anniversary with a satirical piece, noting that he had reached out to Reid\u2019s attorney last week regarding the status of the FBI\u2019s investigation into the alleged hacking and got no response but received an auto-reply on Monday with Reichman saying that he would \u201cbe overseas\u201d until April 29. Fox News received the same response when reaching out for comment. MSNBC also did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019\u00a0request for comment.

Former British spy Christopher Steele confessed that he used an unverified report submitted to a CNN website, where \u201crandom individuals\u201d can post information, for his salacious anti-Trump dossier. Steele made the awkward revelation during a deposition last year in a case involving Russian entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev, who claims his companies Webzilla and XBT Holdings were defamed by Steele after the dossier was published by BuzzFeed. RUSSIAN TECH FIRM USED IN HACKING OF DEMOCRATS, MCCAIN'S ASSOCIATE DISSEMINATED STEELE DOSSIER, UNSEALED DOCUMENTS SHOW Steele was asked during the deposition how he verified allegations about Gubarev's companies and whether he found \u201canything of relevance concerning Webzilla,\u201d according to the newly released transcripts of the deposition. \u201cWe did. It was an article I have got here which was posted on July 28, 2009, on something called CNN iReport,\u201d Steele said. But CNN iReport, which appears to be no longer active -- though archives remain accessible online -- states\u00a0that it\u2019s a \u201cuser-generated site\u201d and warns that \u201cthe stories submitted by users are not edited, fact-checked or screened before they post.\u201d \u201cThe stories submitted by users are not edited, fact-checked or screened before they post.\u201d Even the site\u2019s banner included the slogan \u201cUnedited. Unfiltered. News.\u201d Former British spy Christopher Steele confessed that he used an unverified report submitted to a CNN website, where \u201crandom individuals\u201d can post information, for his salacious anti-Trump dossier. When asked whether the former British spy understood how the website actually worked, he confessed that \u201cI do not have any particular knowledge of that\u201d and noted he didn\u2019t understand at the time that the site has \u201cno connection to any CNN reporters.\u201d \u201cDo you understand that CNN iReports are or were nothing more than any random individuals\u2019 assertions on the Internet?\u201d an examiner asked Steele. He replied: \u201cNo, I obviously presume that if it is on a CNN site that it may has [sic] some kind of CNN status. Albeit that it may be an independent person posting on the site.\u201d \u201cNo, I obviously presume that if it is on a CNN site that it may has [sic] some kind of CNN status. Albeit that it may be an independent person posting on the site.\u201d According to the archive\u00a0copy of the iReports site, the website specifically notes that none of the users who submit content can be described as working for CNN. \u201cBeing an iReport.com user and creating and uploading content to iReport.com does not mean that you work for CNN, and you should never represent yourself as working for CNN,\u201d the site\u2019s FAQ section read. COURT FILES REVEAL ROLE OF MCCAIN, ASSOCIATE IN SPREADING ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER The dossier authored by Steele alleged that Gubarev's companies \u201cused botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct 'alerting operations' against the Democratic Party leadership\u201d and that Gubarev himself played a \u201csignificant\u201d part in the operation while \u201cunder duress\u201d from the Russian security agency FSB. The latest revelation of using unconfirmed sources put the dossier\u2019s legitimacy further into question, especially since the FBI extensively relied on the dossier in its warrant applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court in seeking to surveil Trump aide Carter Page.

House Republicans announced Wednesday that they have entered an outline of the controversial \"Green New Deal\" and a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the sweeping Democratic proposal into the Congressional Record after the document was deleted from the website of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. \"It's very important the American people see that there be transparency about what [Democrats] are pushing,\" Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., told reporters at the House GOP's weekly press conference. \"And we call on (House)\u00a0Speaker (Nancy)\u00a0Pelosi, (D-Calif.),\u00a0to put this up for a vote on the floor. \"We think Democrats need to be held accountable. If they support this as they say they do and as their presidential candidates do,\" Cheney added,\" then let's have a vote on it and see to what extent they're all going to get behind moving toward this kind of fantasy.\" AOC ADVISER ADMITS HE FALSELY CLAIMED GREEN NEW DEAL DIDN'T PROMISE SECURITY FOR THOSE 'UNWILLING' TO WORK According to the outline, which can still be viewed using the Internet archiving service Wayback Machine, the Green New Deal is \"a 10-year plan to create a greenhouse gas neutral society\" through what it describes as \"a World War 2 scale mobilization that\u00a0focuses the robust and creative economic engine of the United States on reversing climate change by fully rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, restoring our natural ecosystems, dramatically expanding renewable power generation, overhauling our entire transportation system, upgrading all our buildings, jumpstarting\u00a0US clean manufacturing (and)\u00a0transforming US agriculture.\" WATCH: LIZ CHENEY ROILS DEMS IN CLIMATE CHANGE HEARING BY PRESSING WITNESSES ON GREEN NEW DEAL The outline says the Green New Deal would provide \"(e)conomic security to\u00a0all who are unable or unwilling to work.\" It also notes that the proposal's goal is \"to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions ... because we aren\u2019t sure that we will be able to fully get rid of, for example,\u00a0emissions from cows or air travel before then.\" Cheney's request for Pelosi to put the Green New Deal resolution up for a vote on the House floor follows a similar move from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said Tuesday that he would bring the matter before the upper chamber of Congress to \"give everybody an opportunity to go on record.\" GREEN NEW DEAL MOCKED IN FYRE FESTIVAL PARODY, AS GOP TURNS PLAN INTO PUNCHING BAG The Green New Deal\u00a0is already supported by at least five senators seeking the Democratic nomination for president: Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who could also enter the Democratic primary, is another\u00a0supporter. Klobuchar described the Green New Deal as \"aspirational\" in an interview Tuesday night with Fox News' \"Special Report with Bret Baier.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I see it as a jumpstart,\" Klobuchar said. \"So I would vote yes, but I would also \u2014 if it got down to the nitty-gritty of ... actual legislation as opposed to, 'oh here's some goals we have,' that would be different for me.\" A seventh potential candidate in 2020, Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, pointedly declined Tuesday to attach his name and dismissed liberal activists' contention that he has to support the Green New Deal in order to prove his commitment to the issue. \"I don't need to co-sponsor every bill that others think they need to co-sponsor to show my progressive politics,\" Brown told reporters.

A top adviser to New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has admitted that an official \"Green New Deal\" document posted by Ocasio-Cortez's office contained a guarantee of economic security even for those \"unwilling to work\" -- but not before he went viral in progressive circles for claiming the exact opposite, repeatedly, in an interview with Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Cornell University Law School Professor Robert Hockett, who counsels Ocasio-Cortez on\u00a0environmental initiatives, challenged host Tucker Carlson when he quoted from an outline and\u00a0list of \"frequently asked questions\" (FAQ) that had been posted on Ocasio-Cortez's official website. A similar version of the FAQ was also shared with NPR. The\u00a0FAQ\u00a0and background materials from Ocasio-Cortez's website stated\u00a0that the Green New Deal\u00a0will provide \"Economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work,\" and the FAQ sent to NPR also noted,\u00a0\"We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.\" Ocasio-Cortez's office removed the documents from her website amid an online backlash. A version of the FAQ that referred to \"farting cows\" is\u00a0still available on NPR's website,\u00a0and a similar version that was posted to Ocasio-Cortez's website is currently viewable\u00a0on an\u00a0Internet archiving service. Both versions of the documents describe providing economic security for those \"unwilling to work,\" and state, \"This is a massive transformation of our society with clear goals and a timeline\" at a \"scale not seen since World War 2.\" Carlson asked Hockett at the outset of the interview: \"Why would we ever pay people who are 'unwilling to work'?\" OCASIO-CORTEZ CONTRADICTS HERSELF IN 12 HOURS ON ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN 'GREEN NEW DEAL' In a head-turning moment heard around the Internet, Hockett replied flatly, \"Uh, we never would, right? And AOC has never said anything like that, right? I think you're referring to some sort of document -- I think some\u00a0doctored document that somebody other than us has been circulating. ... She's actually tweeted it out to laugh at it, if you look at her latest tweets. It seems apparently, some Republicans have put it out there. I don't know the details.\" Radio talk show host Tony Katz weighs in on the Democrats' Green New 'Dream.' That was an apparent reference to a Thursday tweet by Ocasio-Cortez that criticized parody versions of the Green New Deal FAQ, including one that said, effective immediately, \"males should urinate into an empty milk jug instead of a toilet.\" The parody versions cited by Ocasio-Cortez in the tweet did not contain any reference to providing economic security for those \"unwilling to work.\" \"When your #GreenNewDeal legislation is so strong that the GOP has to resort to circulating false versions, but the real one nets 70 House cosponsors on Day 1 and all Dem presidential candidates sign on anyway,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote, along with a picture of the parody version containing the urination reference. Later in the interview, Hockett doubled down that Ocasio-Cortez's official FAQ did not include a reference to a guarantee of universal economic stability even for those \"unwilling\" to work: \"Definitely not. That's erroneous. It's the wrong document. That's not us.\" Cows have been targeted for potential elimination in the Green New Deal (iStock). The exchange prompted a flurry of support for Hockett on social media among liberal audiences. The left-wing activist group Media Matters for America wrote\u00a0in a widely shared post, \"Watch what happens when Tucker Carlson steps outside the conservative media bubble and gets fact-checked on Green New Deal falsehoods.\" But over the weekend,\u00a0Saikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, admitted\u00a0that the FAQ shared with NPR and posted on Ocasio-Cortez's website was genuine. Metadata from the document posted by NPR confirmed that Chakrabarti was listed as one of the authors of the FAQ. \u201cAn early draft of a FAQ that was clearly unfinished and that doesn\u2019t represent the GND [Green New Deal] resolution got published to the website by mistake,\u201d\u00a0Chakrabarti tweeted. \u201cBut what\u2019s in the resolution is the GND.\u201d Both Chakrabarti and Ocasio-Cortez also referred supporters to a stripped-down resolution they formally introduced in Congress. But the resolution also calls for \"guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage,\" plus benefits, to \"all people of the United States.\" 2020 DEMS JUMP TO ENDORSE GREEN NEW DEAL, DESPITE SPENDING TENS OF\u00a0 THOUSANDS ON PRIVATE JETS Hockett did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment Sunday, but in an email late Saturday to The Daily Caller, he admitted his error. (Media Matters for America, on the other hand, has not corrected its previous post.) Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 'Green New Deal' aims to phase out fossil fuels in 10 years. \u201cIt appears there was more than one document being discussed yesterday, only one of which I had heard about with any definiteness by last evening after a long day of media appearances \u2013 namely, the one referred to by the Congresswoman in her tweet,\u201d Hockett wrote. \u201cI regret that we seem unknowingly to have ended up speaking about different documents for a minute during our longer and otherwise \u2018on-the-same-page\u2019 conversation last night.\u201d On her Twitter account Saturday,\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez herself acknowledged\u00a0that a FAQ \"got uploaded + taken down,\" without explaining or providing additional detail. \"There are multiple doctored GND resolutions and FAQs floating around,\" she wrote.\u00a0\"There was also a draft version that got uploaded + taken down. There\u2019s also draft versions floating out there.\" Still, several media outlets praised Hockett and Ocasio-Cortez's handling of the situation. A headline from Business Insider read: \"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accidentally released a document that supported paying Americans 'unwilling to work,' and conservatives attacked her for it.\" The article did not provide support for its contention that Ocasio-Cortez's office had accidentally released the document. KIMBERLEY STRASSEL: IS OCASIO-CORTEZ THE GOP'S SECRET 2020 WEAPON? And a report from The Huffington Post\u00a0asserted that Carlson had been \"fact-checked on his own show.\" Meanwhile, Hockett\u00a0appeared to compare Ocasio-Cortez's efforts to the classic novel \"Ulysses,\" which author Virginia Woolf famously called a \"memorable catastrophe.\" \"Literary historians can talk about pirated versions of Ulysses, discarded drafts, notes that Joyce wrote to himself, even his grocery lists,\" Hockett wrote.\u00a0\"But at some point shouldn't we start reading the actual book -- the huge game-changing work that got signed and published?\" The stakes are high not only for the liberal freshman, but also the Democratic Party at large. The Green New Deal plan, which calls for a massive package of big-government proposals including health care for all, quickly picked up the backing of major 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Cory Booker, D-N.J. --\u00a0who all co-sponsored the resolution. \u201cOur history is a testimony to the achievement of what some think is impossible \u2014 we must take bold action now,\u201d Booker tweeted last week. The White House appeared heartened by the Democratic contenders' support for the sweeping program. \"I think half the announced presidential candidates that are Democrats have supported this, although they aren\u2019t really sure what it is,\" Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told \"Fox News Sunday.\" Mulvaney added:\u00a0\"The other half -- I don\u2019t know where the Democrat Party is on this, I know where the Republican Party is, and by the way, it\u2019s fun to be in a party that is united while the other is divided.\" SHOULD BE ABOLISH ICE BECAUSE LATINOS ARE 'NATIVE' TO THE U.S.? OCASIO-CORTEZ SAYS ABSOLUTELY New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined climate protesters during a sit-in late last year in soon-to-be House speaker Nancy Pelosi's office. The plan\u00a0and accompanying documents from Ocasio-Cortez include\u00a0a range of far-fetched goals -- and drew swift scorn from Republicans and other critics. The Republican National Committee dubbed it a \"Socialist wish list\" that would kill at least 1 million jobs and disrupt global trade -- while costing trillions. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As Mulvaney implied, the Green New Deal push has seen\u00a0resistance not only from Republicans, but also\u00a0some key Democrats. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, was asked about the plan to replace planes with high-speed rail and did not seem impressed. \u201cThat would be pretty hard for Hawaii,\u201d she laughed. On Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to dismiss the plan. \u201cIt will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,\u201d Pelosi told\u00a0Politico on Wednesday. \u201cThe green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they\u2019re for it right?\u201d Even aside from the Green New Deal, conservative commentators\u00a0have argued\u00a0that most proposed solutions to global warming would do more\u00a0harm than good, and also have accused climate activists of crying wolf. In 2006, a NASA scientist and leading global warming researcher\u00a0declared that the world had only\u00a010 years\u00a0to avert a climate catastrophe\u00a0-- a deadline that has come and gone.

(NASA) A pilot died and another was injured Tuesday when an Air Force\u00a0trainer aircraft crashed at Laughlin Air Force in Texas, Air Force officials said. Authorities did not identify the pilots, pending notification to their families. The injured pilot was taken to the Val Verde Regional Medical Center with unknown injuries. The T-38C Talon went down around 7:40 p.m. on the\u00a0Del Rio military installation, located a few miles near the U.S.-Mexico border, an Air Force statement said. Emergency responders were at the scene. The cause of the crash is still under investigation. \"Additional details will be provided as information becomes available,\" Laughlin AFB officials said in a statement posted on Facebook. The\u00a0T-38 Talon, manufactured by Northrop Grumman, is a two-seat, twin-engine supersonic jet trainer, Patch Downtown Austin reported. More than 210 aircraft losses and ejections have been documented over the aircraft's lifetime since its debut in the 1950s, according to Wayback Machine, a website that documents plane crashes. The crash comes two weeks after the Air Force removed three commanders at the Texas base over \u201cdangerous and threatening behavior.\u201d Last year, a pilot instructor was killed when his T-38 crashed a few miles from the base, according to the Air Force Times.

Mark Warner, via Twitter) Google was given \"the empty chair treatment\" at the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Wednesday, a sign lawmakers are fuming that neither CEO Sundar Pichai or Larry Page, chairman of parent company Alphabet, chose to attend the event to discuss election interference. Instead of Pichai or Page, Mountain View, Calif.-based Google offered its top lawyer, Kent Walker, to the committee, an offer that was declined.\u00a0 Facebook sent its Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter sent its CEO Jack Dorsey. REPORT REVEALS GOOGLE IS TRACKING YOU IF YOU LIKE IT OR NOT Alphabet is the holding company, founded in 2015, that holds Google, along with several other businesses, including autonomous cars. News of a \"empty chair treatment\" first emerged when Sen. Mark Warner (D.-Va.) told CNBC last week it could be a possibility. \"Chances are there's going to be an empty chair there,\" Sen. Warner told the financial news outlet last week.\u00a0 \"I think there will be a lot more questions raised that could have been actually dealt with if they sent a senior decision-maker and not simply their counsel.\" In his opening statement, Warner again expressed his dismay that Google did not send its top executives. \"I\u2019m deeply disappointed that Google \u2013 one of the most influential digital platforms in the world \u2013 chose not to send its own top corporate leadership to engage this committee,\" Warner said. Warner continued: \"I know our members have a series of difficult questions about structural vulnerabilities on a number of Google\u2019s platforms that we will need answered.\u00a0 From Google Search, which continues to have problems surfacing absurd conspiracies\u2026.To YouTube, where Russian-backed disinformation agents promoted hundreds of divisive videos\u2026.To Gmail, where state-sponsored operatives attempt countless hacking attempts, Google has an immense responsibility in this space.\u00a0 Given its size and influence, I would have thought the leadership at Google would want to demonstrate how seriously it takes these challenges and to lead this important public discussion.\" Google did not respond to Fox News' request on Pichai or Page's whereabouts. It did however offer a statement, noting that over the past 18 months, it has met with \"dozens of Committee Members and briefed major Congreessional Committees numerous times\" on its work to prevent foreign interference in U.S. elections. A Google spokesman said that Walker, its SVP of Global Affairs and Chief Legal Officer, is in Washington D.C. today to deliver \"written testimony, brief Members of Congress on our work and answer any questions they have,\" before adding the company understood Walker would be \"an appropriate witness for this hearing\" when it discussed this in late July. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said Tuesday that Google doesn't \"understand the problem\" if it doesn't want to work with the government to find solutions. HOW TO FIND AND DELETE WHERE GOOGLE KNOWS YOU'VE BEEN The back-and-forth with Google is the latest in a year's worth of attempts by Congress to force the companies to focus more sharply on the Russian interference issue. While Burr says he believes Facebook and Twitter do understand the problem, it took both companies several months last year to acknowledge they had been manipulated. It also underscores how difficult the problem may be to solve. While the companies have made many changes around their policies and have caught and banned hordes of malicious accounts over the past year, their business models \u2014 free services that rely on attracting as many users as possible for as long as possible and finding out as much about them as possible \u2014 remain the same. Some critics have charged that unless they change this, they will continue to contend with bad actors taking advantage of their systems. The company has come under pressure from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in recent weeks. President Trump also accused the tech giant of snubbing his State of the Union address.

MSNBC provided viewers with one of the most tone-deaf moments in cable news history on Tuesday when Andrea Mitchell asked Joy Reid about a racist tweet that Roseanne Barr sent about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett. Last month, Reid\u00a0famously kinda-sorta admitted to writing homophobic slurs\u00a0that she\u2019d previously insisted were the work of diabolical hackers. On Tuesday, after Barr sent a racist tweet, Mitchell asked Reid \u2013 who is in Philadelphia to co-moderate a town hall event \u2013 about social media behavior in a moment that was captured by TheWrap\u2019s Jon Levine. Mitchell asked, \"What do you have to do on social media to get fired from a top rated show on an American broadcast network?\" Reid responded by pointing to the specific language of Barr\u2019s apology, noting that admitting the jab was about Jarrett\u2019s appearance was proof that the message was racist. \u201cThat was a very telling part of the apology,\u201d Reid said.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not surprised, this is the kind of humor that Roseanne does.\u201d Following the discovery of the homophobic slurs and intense speculation about her own future, the \u201cAM Joy\u201d host addressed that situation during the April 28 episode of her show that airs every Saturday and Sunday morning. \u201cI genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things,\u201d Reid told her viewers, adding,\u00a0\"The person I am now is not the person I was then.\" Reid got emotional on the air and admitted it seemed unlikely she was hacked, but that she didn\u2019t recall making the offensive remarks, for which she apologized anyway. She also admitted to making several slurs on Twitter \u2013 which makes Tuesday\u2019s question by Mitchell especially ironic. Reid was never punished for her homophobic tweets. Media watchdogs were quick to notice the irony that Reid was used by MSNBC to offer her opinion on Barr. Mediaite columnist Joseph Wulfhsohn wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s rich that she\u2019s talking about it with Joy Reid, of all people.\u201d \u201cWhat the hell does someone have to do to get fired from a network these days? To help me answer this question I\u2019m bringing in Joy Reid & Brian Williams,\u201d Fox News contributor Stephen Miller joked. Upon hearing that ABC had canceled \u201cRoseanne,\u201d pundit Mark Simone wrote, \"Looks like the only network Roseanne could work at now is MSNBC, they've had a host accused of racist posts, anti-gay posts, and anti-Muslim posts and don't cancel their show, if they apologize.\u201d BuzzFeed\u2019s Steven Perlberg wrote, \u201cAs it happens, it's been one month and Joy Reid's hacker \u2014 the one who made her old anti-gay blog posts slightly more anti-gay and manipulated the Wayback Machine \u2014 remains at large. This morning I asked MSNBC for an update in the investigation, but haven't heard back.\u201d MSNBC did not immediately respond to request for comment.

MSNBC host Joy Reid, who\u2019s been sharply criticized for homophobic language in her old blog, is no homophobe. I can say this with confidence as someone who has met her, interacted with her off-camera, and even discussed LGBT equality with her on MSNBC. I know that in her heart of hearts, Reid does not have a shred of contempt for gay people today. But did she ever? Probably. And could this compromise her journalistic integrity moving forward? The answer to that question remains to be seen. Hints at what Reid\u2019s future holds were on full display last Saturday when \u2013 flanked by a panel of LGBT supporters on her MSNBC show \u2013 she was praised by liberal activist Brandon Wolf. Wolf shunted aside any criticism of Reid and instead turned his ire on Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 who no one claims had any involvement with Reid\u2019s blog. Wolf made this preposterous claim: \u201cIf Mike Pence, God bless him, ended up in the White House, sitting behind that desk in the Oval Office, he would have us all in concentration camps hoping to pray away the gay.\u201d Concentration camps? Wolf\u2019s hyperbolic comment went entirely unchallenged by Reid \u2013 and really, how could she challenge it? Reid is no longer in any position to question the opinion of any of her LGBT guests. Reid offered an underwhelming apology for posts on her blog from a decade ago, which were critical of people who were gay or suspected of being gay. She stated: \u201cI genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things.\u201d But Reid was clearly walking on eggshells with her guests, all of whom were members of the LGBT community, and all of them Democrats. People can change, and that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s one of the key goals of Log Cabin Republicans \u2013 the nation\u2019s original and largest organization representing LGBT conservatives and straight allies who support fairness, freedom and equality for all Americans \u2013 where I serve as president. If it was impossible to change the hearts and minds of Republicans on issues related to LGBT equality, we wouldn\u2019t have made gains on marriage equality and non-discrimination legislation. Just this week, in the Republican-controlled state Senate, New Hampshire legislators passed a historic transgender non-discrimination law. But changing the opinions of our fellow Americans on LGBT issues hasn\u2019t been a challenge exclusive to Republicans. In 2006, the blog post Reid now claims was fabricated stated that \u201cmost straight people cringe at the sight of two men kissing.\u201d At the time, that was true \u2013 gay people knew that. And therein lies the indication that Reid in all likelihood was the author of each of these newly unearthed archived blog posts. If someone was going to hack the Internet Archive, doctor old posts, and then leak them to a left-wing activist to post on Twitter in an elaborate attempt to smear Joy Reid, the hacker would have probably written something more inflammatory. For example, a hacker out to really get Reid could write something like: \u201cGay people should be in concentration camps hoping to pray away the gay\u201d and falsely claim Reid wrote such a hateful comment. If you are Reid\u2019s age or older, you came of age in a culture that wasn\u2019t nearly as welcoming of the LGBT community as it is today. There is certainly still a lot of prejudice directed at the LGBT community today, but a lot less than in years past. The entire controversy over Reid\u2019s old blog could be a teachable moment about how Americans of all stripes \u2013 even journalists and liberals \u2013 have taken the journey from intolerance to love, or at least acceptance, of those who are LGBT. Tortuous as it was, I know Joy Reid\u2019s apology was sincere. Of far greater concern is how this needlessly protracted scandal will impact Reid\u2019s coverage of LGBT issues in the future. Will Reid be able to be an ally of the LGBT community while treating Republicans \u2013 many of whom are currently on the same journey she took over the past 12 years \u2013 fairly? Stay tuned.

MSNBC star Joy Reid claims that homophobic comments on her old blog, \u201cThe Reid Report,\u201d were not written by her -- despite the fact that she has already apologized for much of the rhetoric. Reid apologized last December when the old blog posts \u2014\u00a0unearthed by a Twitter user and reported by\u00a0Mediaite\u00a0-- came to light. Less than five months later, Reid is changing her tune and told Mediaite that the homophobic content does \u201cnot represent the original entries\u201d on her site, essentially claiming archives were hacked. Reid allegedly published a dozen blog posts from 2007-2009 containing remarks that are highly offensive\u00a0to the LGBTQ community. MSNBC prides itself on being progressive, and Reid\u2019s alleged decade-old comments directly contradict the network\u2019s typical direction. The old blog targeted former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who Reid mocked as \u201cMiss Charlie,\u201d for being gay and closeted, even though there is no proof to back her claims. The posts fanned rumors of Crist\u2019s sexual orientation and his political opponents tried to tar him with the gossip during his governorship \u2014\u00a0when he was a Republican. Mediaite reported that it received links to Reid\u2019s old blog through the\u00a0Wayback Machine, an Internet archiving service. Reid apologized at the time, admitting she wrote the homophobic slurs. \u201cThis note is my apology to all who are disappointed by the content of blogs I wrote a decade ago, for which my choice of words and tone have legitimately been criticized,\u201d the MSNBC star wrote on Dec. 3. \u201cI regret the way I addressed the complex issue of the closet and speculation on a person\u2019s sexual orientation with a mocking tone and sarcasm. It was insensitive, tone deaf and dumb. There is no excusing it.\u201d Additional anti-gay blog posts from the now-defunct blog were discovered last week and the\u00a0Wayback Machine has reportedly, mysteriously removed access to Reid\u2019s old archives \u2013 but an Internet sleuth preserved screen shots. Reid\u2019s latest statement to Mediaite backtracks on the original apology and claims that archives of her site had been tampered with. MSNBC host Joy Reid claims she did not write homophobic remarks displayed on the archives of her old blog. (2015 Ron Adar) \u201cIn December I learned that an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material from my now-defunct blog,\u00a0The Reid Report, to include offensive and hateful references that are fabricated and run counter to my personal beliefs and ideology,\u201d Reid told Mediaite. \u201cThe manipulated material seems to be part of an effort to taint my character with false information by distorting a blog that ended a decade ago.\u201d Reid also claims that she is working with a cybersecurity expert, notified federal law enforcement officials and blames any pain dished out to the LGBTQ community on \u201cwhoever corrupted the site.\u201d The Justice Department did not immediately respond when asked to verify Reid\u2019s claim. MSNBC did not immediately respond when asked for comment. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear when the nefarious hackers would have hacked her site and added the controversial content, since it has been defunct for years and still is. More importantly, NBC could or would not specify exactly which posts Reid is claiming were doctored,\u201d Mediaite\u2019s Caleb Ecarma wrote. The Wayback Machine did not respond to requests for comment. When reached last year, MSNBC declined to comment regarding whether Reid was going to be disciplined for her site\u2019s apparent homophobic remarks and anti-gay jokes shortly after they were unearthed. MSNBC did not immediately respond when asked on Monday if the network would investigate her new claims. It\u2019s easy to see why Reid would want to distance herself from the offensive post, as Rachel Maddow, MSNBC\u2019s most-watched host and cash cow, is openly gay. The old blog post belittled Crist as dreading physical relations with his wife on their honeymoon and even included a joke about Crist having sex with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Reid commented in the blog that Crist got married to a woman in the first place to help him become McCain\u2019s 2008 running mate. Mediaite counted 17 times Reid's blog derisively referred to Crist as \u201cMiss Charlie,\u201d and the subject led her to opine on why gay men stay in the closet. \u201cWhen a gay politician gets married, it usually indicates that he is highly ambitious, and desires to put himself in a position to move up the power ladder,\u201d\u00a0The Reid Report stated. The blog further mocked Crist with tags \u201cgay politicians\u201d and \u201cnot gay politicians.\u201d The alleged posts were written at the time when Crist was a conservative Republican. Back in 2012, Crist joined the Democratic Party and endorsed Barack Obama for re-election. Reid\u2019s old blog also defended a series of controversial homophobic comments made by former NBA star Tim Hardaway and Marine General\u00a0Peter Pace and attempted to out then-closeted gay men Anderson Cooper and Clay Aiken. The website also questioned or made jokes about the sexuality of Karl Rove, Tom Cruise, Sean Hannity, Heath Ledger, Dick Cheney, George W. Bush, Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Queen Latifah, Eddie Murphy and Keith Olbermann, among others, according to Mediaite. The Reid Report reportedly even mocked the sexuality of her now-superstar colleague, Maddow. Reid is now a liberal hero and prominent voice of the #Resistance movement, but it appears that she is either being dishonest about the archives being hacked or was disingenuous when originally admitting to the homophobic rhetoric. MSNBC did not respond when asked why Reid apologized if she didn\u2019t actually write the bog entries.

NBC scrubbed all promotional images of Matt Lauer from its 'Today' show website and social media pages Wednesday (Reuters) NBC scrubbed all promotional images of Matt Lauer from its \u201cToday\u201d show social media pages Wednesday, as the network continues to distance itself from the disgraced former anchor. Prior to Lauer\u2019s abrupt termination amid sexual harassment allegations, the \u201cToday\u201d show\u2019s Twitter and Facebook accounts featured a collage of images, including a shot of Lauer smiling broadly while holding a puppy, flanked by co-hosts Al Roker and Savannah Guthrie. The old social media imagery, which is still accessible via Internet aggregator Wayback Machine, also included a picture of Lauer and Savannah grinning at the anchor desk. And on the \u201cToday\u201d website, Lauer and Guthrie were previously pictured smiling in front of a blurred image of their studio in Rockefeller Plaza. Within hours of the announcement of Lauer\u2019s firing, all of that changed. On the \"Today\" website, all that remained Thursday morning was a blurred image of a studio, with no one visible in the image. And on Twitter and Facebook, a new photo collage appeared, now prominently featuring \"Today\" host Megyn Kelly in the top-left. In the center, instead of Lauer with the dog, are Roker and Guthrie at the anchor desk. The remaining \u201cToday\u201d hosts did not take questions concerning Lauer\u2019s termination at the Rockefeller Christmas Tree lighting ceremony Wednesday, as speculation continues as to who will replace the longtime morning show veteran. With Lauer's departure, Kelly is now the highest-paid NBC News anchor, according to\u00a0Fortune Magazine. After Lauer's removal, Kelly said that she had heard rumors about Lauer's alleged misconduct. \"I had heard rumors about Matt, but that's all they were,\" Kelly told\u00a0Business Insider. \"And my feeling on it was that rumors are not the same as reportable fact.

William La Jeunesse reports from Los Angeles Voters say they hate negative ads \u2013 but if Iowa is any gauge, the campaigns aren\u2019t too worried about that. Up to a third of the Republican ads that aired in Iowa could be considered attack spots, pointing out the inconsistencies and flip-flops of rival candidates. Why so much negativity? Well, it works, analysts say. \"Clearly, the research shows that people basically remember negative ads more than they remember the positive ads,\" political strategist Bill Carrick said. \"In this time where people are so cynical about politics and politicians, they're usually very inclined to believe something negative about somebody, and less, less inclined to believe the positive.\" Anyone looking to pore through those ads and more can go to the Political TV Ad Archive. The archive, a project of the nonprofit Internet Archive, provides a searchable, viewable and shareable online archive of 2016 primary election political TV ads. By assembling and cataloging every ad produced and aired, the group found the campaigns bombarded Iowa viewers with more than 350 hours of political ads in December and January. In Iowa and New Hampshire alone, during a two-month period, voters saw more than 900 ads a day, produced by a candidate or their PAC. \"The clutter is huge,\" said Carrick, who served as the late Sen. Ted Kennedy's political director and as national manager for Richard Gephardt's presidential campaign. \"Breaking through that clutter is really one of the big imperatives of all of the advertising teams.\" In Iowa, Hillary Clinton led all candidates with more than 5,200 minutes, or 87 hours, of ads. Bernie Sanders was a close second. Sen. Marco Rubio bought the most time of any Republican, with 3,400 minutes -- almost double Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Trump and Rubio were each targeted in 13 negative ads, more than any other candidate. For former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, that number was only five. Cruz produced more negative ads than any other candidate, but a single Trump spot attacking Cruz on immigration aired 1,377 times -- among the highest of all negative spots. The single most-aired negative ad was paid for by a Jeb Bush super PAC attacking Rubio for flip-flopping on a variety of issues. The most-aired spot -- at 1,850 times -- featured Sanders attacking Wall Street, followed by a Trump spot featuring the candidate's views on immigration and terrorism -- at 1,759 times. And while most fact-checkers go after the half-truths and exaggerations of attack spots, Carrick said critics usually find bigger fibs in the positive ads. \"When the candidates start bragging on themselves, it tends to get a little bit embellished,\" he said. \"While the negative ads, they've got flying newspaper headlines and verification, and backup because people [see] they're news as opposed to entertainment.\" Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Kevin Corke with what to expect from the speech. One of the women who accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of making advances on her when she was a teen and he a local prosecutor admitted Friday to forging part of the yearbook inscription she offered as proof. Beverly Young Nelson now says part of the inscription near Roy Moore's signature was not written by Moore.  (AP)  Beverly Young Nelson told ABC News she wrote part of the disputed note in her high school yearbook that she and famed attorney Gloria Allred presented as proof the then-30-something Moore sought an inappropriate relationship with her in the late 1970s. Nelson still insisted that Moore wrote most of the message and signed the inscription, but said she made \u201cnotes\u201d to it. \u201cHe did sign it,\u201d Nelson told ABC\u2019s Tom Llamas.   (Beverly Young Nelson has accused Republican Roy Moore of making advances on her when she was a teen.)  Moore has denied signing the yearbook and said he did not know Nelson at the time. Moore, who went on to become a judge and then the chief justice of the Alabama State Supreme Court, later ruled against Nelson in a 1999 divorce case. Moore, 70, is running against Doug Jones in a bruising special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, who President Trump named Attorney General, and then held on an interim basis by Luther Strange. The election is Tuesday. The Nelson accusation had bolstered claims by other women that Moore sought relationships with teenage girls in the late 1970s. Leigh Corfman claims Moore molested her when she was 14. Another woman claims Moore groped her in his office in 1991.
