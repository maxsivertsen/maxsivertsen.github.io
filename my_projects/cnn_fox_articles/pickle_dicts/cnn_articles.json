{"Tim Walz\u2019s 2006 campaign falsely described details about his arrest for DWI in 1995 | CNN Politics": " When Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz first ran for Congress in 2006, his campaign repeatedly made false statements about the details of his 1995 arrest for drunk and reckless driving.   According to court and police records connected to the incident, Walz admitted in court that he had been drinking when he was pulled over for driving 96 mph in a 55 mph zone in Nebraska. Walz was then transported by a state trooper to a local hospital for a blood test, showing he had a blood alcohol level of .128, well above the state\u2019s legal limit of 0.1 at the time.   But in 2006, his campaign repeatedly told the press that he had not been drinking that night, claiming that his failed field sobriety test was due to a misunderstanding related to hearing loss from his time in the National Guard. The campaign also claimed that Walz was allowed to drive himself to jail that night.   None of that was true.   A CNN KFile review of statements made by the Walz campaign at the time reveals numerous discrepancies between how the campaign described the events and the facts of what actually took place that night.   \u201cThe DUI charge was dropped for a Reason: it wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Walz\u2019s then-campaign communications director told local news in 2006. \u201cThe trooper had him drive to the station and then leave on his own after being at the station. Tim feels bad about speeding and has paid the ticket and apologized to his family at the time it happened.\u201d   In fact, the incident\u2019s police report clearly states that Walz was transported by police to a local hospital for blood alcohol testing after being arrested. And this week, Nebraska state police confirmed to CNN that Walz was taken by a state trooper to jail.   \u201cUnder NSP procedure, a person suspected of impaired driving is not allowed to continue driving,\u201d Cody Thomas, a spokesman for the Nebraska State Patrol, told CNN. \u201cIn this case, the suspect was transported by the trooper and was lodged in Dawes County Jail.\u201d   Now that Walz is the Democratic nominee for vice president, renewed scrutiny is being paid to the details of his 1995 arrest and how his campaign described the incident a decade later as he launched his political career.   Walz has subsequently acknowledged the facts of the case, admitting during his 2018 campaign for governor of Minnesota that he had been drinking and driving.   On Tuesday, the Daily Beast published an interview with the state trooper who arrested Walz. He disputed claims that Walz had not been drinking and noted that sobriety test had nothing to do with hearing.   The Harris-Walz campaign declined to comment for this story.   On the night of September 23, 1995, Walz, then a 31-year-old high school teacher, was pulled over by a Nebraska state trooper for speeding, having been clocked on radar as going 96 mph in a 55 mph zone. According to the police report, the state trooper detected a strong odor of alcohol on Walz\u2019s breath and requested he take a field sobriety test.   Walz failed the test and was transported by a state trooper to a local hospital for a blood test showing he had a blood alcohol level of .128 \u2013 well above the state\u2019s legal limit of 0.1 at the time.   Walz took a plea deal, court records show, pleading guilty to reckless driving. In a court hearing in March 1996, Walz admitted that he had been drinking and driving.His lawyer said Walz intended to use the incident as a way to educate his students on the perils of drinking and driving.   \u201cIt\u2019s just a dangerous situation,\u201d Walz said in a court transcript, which Alpha News, a conservative Minnesota outlet uncovered in 2022. \u201cNot just to myself, but to others who aren\u2019t even involved with it.\u201d   In court, Walz\u2019s defense attorney said that when the state trooper started following him, Walz believed someone was chasing him and sped up out of fear that he was being pursued until the trooper turned on his police lights.   Walz\u2019s attorney added that he reported the incident to his school and resigned from extracurricular activities such as coaching. He offered to resign his teaching position entirely, his lawyer said, but the principal urged him to stay on.   In 2006, Walz\u2019s congressional campaign offered a very different version of events in numerous statements, according to a CNN KFile review of statements to various local press.   That year, Walz as a first time candidate was in a tight congressional race in the Republican-held district.   Then in early September, a local Republican blog ran the story, \u201cWalz jailed for DUI,\u201d based on a copy of Walz\u2019s ticket for speeding and DUI.   Walz\u2019s campaign disputed that he had been drunk \u2013 and claimed he had driven himself to the station. They did not mention whether or not Walz had been jailed.   The local GOP blog later posted a copy of the police report from the incident to suggest Walz\u2019s campaign was lying in their claims he wasn\u2019t drunk \u2013 but no one in the local press appeared to have followed up on the report.   Walz\u2019s then campaign communications director did not return a CNN request for comment.   In another comment to a local newspaper, archived online by the liberal blog Daily Kos, Walz\u2019s campaign said he denied being drunk.   \u201cAccording to Walz\u2019s campaign staff, Walz denies being drunk the night of the incident. Walz was hard of hearing, a result of his years as an artillery soldier in the Army National Guard, and had trouble hearing the trooper, according to Meredith Salsbery, communications director for the Walz campaign,\u201d read the report in the New Ulm Journal, a local newspaper.   \u201cHe couldn\u2019t understand what the trooper was telling him during the field sobriety test, and the trooper refused to speak up,\u201d Salsbery said at the time.   \u2018The DUI charges were dropped for a reason,\u2019 Salsbery added. \u201cThe judge would not have dismissed them if there were anything to them. Tim drove to the police station that night (after being stopped), and he drove home afterwards. I don\u2019t think the trooper would have allowed that if he thought there was a problem.\u2019\u201d   His campaign manager told a similar story to another local paper.   \u201cWalz\u2019s campaign manager Kerry Greeley didn\u2019t dispute that Walz was speeding when he was pulled over that night, but she said Walz was not drunk. She attributed the misunderstanding to Walz\u2019s deafness, a condition resulting from his years of serving as an artillerist in the Army National Guard,\u201d read an article in the Post Bulletin.   \u201cHe couldn\u2019t understand what the officer was saying to him,\u201d Greeley said.   \u201cShe said deaf people also can have balance issues. The judge eventually threw out the DUI charges against Walz and chastised the officer for not realizing that Walz was deaf, Greeley said,\u201d the report added.   \u201cHe was caught speeding, he doesn\u2019t deny it and that\u2019s the end of it,\u201d she added to the Star Tribune.   Greeley did not respond to a request from CNN for comment.   As Walz\u2019s political career progressed, so did his explanation for his 1995 arrest.   In 2018, when running for governor, Walz offered a markedly different version of events.   According to Walz, the arrest was a life-changing moment, motivating him to change his behavior. He said he has since given up alcohol and his go-to drink is now Diet Mountain Dew.   \u201cYou have responsibilities to others,\u201d Gwen Walz recalled telling her husband. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to make foolish decisions.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN Sans \u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network.", "JD Vance: Workers allege \u2018nightmare\u2019 conditions at AppHarvest, the Kentucky startup he helped fund | CNN Politics": " As a venture capitalist, JD Vance repeatedly touted his guiding principles for investing in a company: A business should not only turn a profit, it should also help American communities.   That\u2019s why, he said, he invested in\u00a0AppHarvest, a startup that promised a high-tech future for farming and for the workers of Eastern Kentucky. Over a four-year span, Vance was an early investor, board member and public pitchman for the indoor-agriculture company.   \u201cIt\u2019s not just a good investment opportunity, it\u2019s a great business that\u2019s making a big difference in the world,\u201d Vance proclaimed in a\u00a0Fox Business interview\u00a0on the day the company went public in February 2021.   Last year, facing hundreds of millions of dollars in debt,\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0declared bankruptcy.   The rise and fall of the company, and Vance\u2019s role in it, cuts against his image as a champion for the working class \u2014 an image that helped catapult him to the top of the Republican ticket as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate.   A CNN review of public documents, and interviews with a dozen former workers, shows that\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0not only failed as a business after pursuing rapid growth, but also provided a grim job experience for many of the working-class Kentuckians Vance has vowed to help.   AppHarvest\u00a0employees said they were forced to work in grueling conditions inside the company\u2019s greenhouse, where temperatures often soared into the triple digits. Complaints filed with the US Department of Labor and a Kentucky regulator between 2020 and 2023 show that workers alleged they were given insufficient water breaks and weren\u2019t provided adequate safety gear. Some workers said they suffered heat exhaustion or injuries, though state inspectors did not find violations.   Despite promising local jobs,\u00a0the company eventually began contracting migrant workers\u00a0from Mexico, Guatemala and other countries, numerous former employees told CNN.   While Vance stepped down from\u00a0AppHarvest\u2019s board and launched his political career in 2021, he remained an investor and supporter of the company. By the time he was sworn in to office last year, the company he\u2019d hailed as a great opportunity was mired in lawsuits filed by shareholders angry over its plummeting stock price and allegations of fraud.   Several former employees told CNN they thought Vance and other board members should have recognized and responded to warning signs that company officials were misleading the public and their own investors.   To some, Vance\u2019s enthusiastic promotion of the company followed an all-too-familiar story line in the region.   \u201cEastern Kentucky is well-known for people coming and going. They start up companies, then they disappear,\u201d said former\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0worker Anthony Morgan. \u201cThey didn\u2019t care about us.\u201d   A spokesperson for Vance, Luke Schroeder, said in a statement that the Ohio senator \u201cwas not aware of the operational decisions regarding hiring, employee benefits, or other workplace policies which were made after he departed\u00a0AppHarvest\u2019s board. Like all early supporters, JD believed in\u00a0AppHarvest\u2019s mission and wishes the company would have succeeded.\u201d   With the blockbuster success of his 2016 memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d Vance was riding high. He had learned how to invest in startups in Silicon Valley, where he worked at PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel\u2019s firm. Thiel would later\u00a0bankroll\u00a0Vance\u2019s own VC fund and Ohio senatorial run.   AOL co-founder Steve Case\u00a0hired\u00a0Vance in 2017 to expand his seed fund Rise of the Rest, which sought to invest in underserved markets. Vance, whose book aimed to explain the plight of America\u2019s forgotten heartland, seemed like the perfect fit.   After about a\u00a0week on the job, Vance took a meeting with\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0founder Jonathan Webb, as Webb later recounted in a\u00a0Fox News podcast interview. Webb, a Kentucky native, had created the company because he saw in his state the potential to build an indoor vertical farming hub\u00a0growing fruits and vegetables, one that was within a day\u2019s drive of most of the US population, and where water and land were abundant.   But he needed money and was running out of time.   Webb had drained his savings and maxed out his credit cards running\u00a0AppHarvest. As he told Fox News, Webb convinced Vance \u201cto write a $150,000 check\u201d to invest in\u00a0AppHarvest, alongside a few other investors, who invested $50,000 each.   Vance was named to the board of directors in March 2017, according to his Senate disclosures, though company security filings stated that he joined in 2020.   When Vance opened his own Ohio-based VC firm, Narya, with\u00a0$93 million\u00a0in funds, one of its earliest\u00a0publicly disclosed investments\u00a0was in\u00a0AppHarvest. In just a few years, Vance helped steer millions of dollars in capital to the company and proved himself an invaluable asset to Webb as a pitchman.   Back in Kentucky, Anthony Morgan left his job at a local automobile parts plant in October 2020 to join\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0as a crop care specialist, pruning tomatoes at the company\u2019s new 60-acre mega greenhouse\u00a0in the Eastern Kentucky city of Morehead.   The company\u2019s health care benefits attracted Morgan, a single father, who told CNN he took a pay cut to join the startup. He was also drawn to the larger promise that Webb sold in frequent interviews in the media: a company committed to Appalachia.   \u201cAppHarvest\u00a0was the talk of the town,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cA major emphasis with them was \u2018we want to bring work to Eastern Kentucky. This is why we are here.\u2019\u201d   The company had\u00a0pledged\u00a0thousands of jobs for \u201chigh unemployment areas,\u201d according to a 2020 investor presentation.\u00a0Much of Eastern Kentucky at the time had been designated\u00a0as economically distressed.   Things started out well, Morgan said. The hours were manageable, and the benefits were better than anything he could hope to get from other employers in the area. Then, a few months in, Morgan recounted a noticeable shift in the company\u2019s culture.   Production fell behind and workers got the message that they needed to pick up the pace, Morgan said. The\u00a0company cut costs, including the employer-paid health care benefits, and managers were tasked with meeting far higher production quotas. That meant longer hours for workers and fewer breaks in the brutal heat of the greenhouse.   \u201cI think about the hottest that I experienced was around 128 degrees,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cA couple days a week, you\u2019d have an ambulance show up and you seen people leaving on gurneys to go to the hospital.\u201d   The conditions became intolerable, and employees began to leave the company in droves, several workers told CNN. Morgan helped organize an employee sit-in to demand fairer working conditions, and said that he was fired after he took time off for medical care for an injury he said he suffered on the job.   \u201cIt was a nightmare that should have never happened,\u201d Morgan said of his experience overall.   Shelby Hester, another crop care specialist, started at\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0in 2021. A recent graduate of nearby Morehead State University, she had been working at a liquor store.   Like Morgan,\u00a0AppHarvest\u2019s lofty and progressive messaging appealed to Hester. She believed the company could \u201ctake me somewhere in life.\u201d A CNN\u00a0story\u00a0that year suggested the company offered a vision for the future of sustainable farming.   Hester\u2019s main responsibility was harvesting the tomatoes right off the vine. She excelled, despite the excessive heat and demanding quotas. Workers, she said, were not provided adequate protection.   \u201cI had to bring in my own N95 masks, because I was getting sick from the amount of mold and just nasty stuff that was in there,\u201d Hester told CNN.   It was the heat, though, that took a toll. Hester echoed Morgan\u2019s account that workers were routinely taken out of the greenhouse by medical personnel because they were suffering from heat stroke symptoms. Those who went to the doctor, she said, were told by managers that a doctor\u2019s note was not a sufficient reason to miss a shift.   On at least three occasions, state government inspectors visited\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0facilities but issued no citations, documents show. Inspectors noted that they observed or heard about safety precautions during their visits, such as mandatory heat breaks and drinks offered to employees.   A spokesperson for Kentucky\u2019s Education and Labor Cabinet said inspections revealed no violations of national guidelines recommended to protect employees from heat-related illnesses, including regular access to fresh drinking water, rest breaks and opportunities to escape high temperatures.   Still, some former workers argue the conditions were at times unsafe. Allegations of harsh working environments were detailed in a\u00a0report\u00a0published last year by Grist\u00a0and the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting.   The company also struggled with what multiple workers described as mismanagement.   \u201cThere was really no direction,\u201d said Andrew Miller, another former crop care specialist at\u00a0AppHarvest, who described the company training as \u201cjust figure it out as you go.\u201d   Another worker described the training as more ideologically driven than focused on the practical day-to-day tasks of doing the job.   \u201cWe watched a movie narrated by David Attenborough, the famous, older environmentalist,\u201d said one former worker named Bethany, who asked that CNN use only her first name. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t talk about how to use the scissor lifts or what was happening our first day.\u201d   Asked for comment,\u00a0the company\u2019s chief restructuring officer, Gary Broadbent, wrote to CNN, \u201cAppHarvest\u00a0has no continuing operations and is not in a position to respond.\u201d   As workers left,\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0replaced them with migrant workers, numerous former employees told CNN. By the early fall of 2021, Hester described a workforce that was made up of many workers from countries such as Mexico and Guatemala.   That juxtaposition with the company\u2019s public messaging on jobs was on full display when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican,\u00a0toured the greenhouse\u00a0that November.   \u201cThey brought Mitch McConnell into the greenhouse, and they sent every single Hispanic worker home before he got there,\u201d Hester said. \u201cHe then proceeded to have a speech about how we were taking the jobs from the Mexicans.\u201d At least five workers confirmed Hester\u2019s account of McConnell\u2019s visit to CNN.   Supporting other worker accounts, Hester\u2019s husband, Mitch Smith, who also worked at\u00a0AppHarvest, told CNN that the migrants were kept in separate bays from other workers and\u00a0were sent away when bigwigs came through the warehouse.   AppHarvest\u00a0acknowledged the hiring of \u201ccontract laborers\u201d in its\u00a02021 annual report\u00a0to the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cIn order to forestall any potential labor shortfall, we have hired contract laborers from outside of the region to help complete our next harvest,\u201d the filing stated. A\u00a0filing\u00a0for the following year stated the company had about 500 full-time employees and 414 independent contractors.   A campaign representative for Vance forwarded a statement from a member of AppHarvest\u2019s senior management team who participated in meetings of the company\u2019s board of directors.   The senior manager, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential exchanges, said, \u201cThe allegations made against\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0do not reflect matters discussed at board meetings during JD\u2019s tenure \u2014 for obvious reasons.\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0implemented robust heat policies when temperatures rose in the summer, months after JD\u2019s departure, continued to cover 100% of employees\u2019 health insurance premiums until mid-2022, and maintained a workforce dedicated to Appalachia throughout its existence.\u201d   On the day\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0went public in February 2021, its shares jumped so high that trading in the stock was briefly halted due to volatility.\u00a0With a total valuation of more than $1 billion, the company\u2019s growth had been meteoric, propelled by millions of venture capital cash, some star power \u2014 Martha Stewart was on the board \u2014 and a compelling story.   But it would all soon fall apart.   That August,\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0reported\u00a0a $32 million loss in its second quarter, citing lower market costs for tomatoes and worker training issues.\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0lost\u00a0more than three-quarters of its value in its first six months as a public company.   The next month came the first shareholder lawsuit. By August 2022, the company was fighting multiple lawsuits. Some alleged executives, including Webb, had misled regulators and investors by overstating the company\u2019s hiring and retention figures. One suit filed by the Plymouth County Retirement Association, a pension fund for employees like firefighters,\u00a0bus drivers and custodians\u00a0in Massachusetts, alleged\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0made \u201cfalse and/or misleading statements\u201d to artificially boost its share price.   AppHarvest\u00a0executives denied the claims and reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with investors this year.   Vance was not named in any of the lawsuits. He left the company\u2019s board in April 2021 and ran for the Senate, though at that time he still had more than $100,000 invested in the company, according to\u00a0disclosures.\u00a0 His VC firm, Narya, also continued to\u00a0express\u00a0public support for the company.   AppHarvest\u00a0filed for bankruptcy last year, weighed down by more than $341 million in debt. In a court filing, Broadbent\u00a0stated the company had experienced a \u201csignificant liquidity crisis\u201d due to lower-than-expected crop yields, \u201chigher-than-expected costs, and tightening of the equity markets and declining stock prices.\u201d   A Canada-based company bought or\u00a0acquired\u00a0leases\u00a0for some of\u00a0AppHarvest\u2019s greenhouses.   On the campaign trail this summer, Vance has promoted an agenda of economic prosperity. During his speech at the Republican National Convention, he talked about his personal record of starting businesses \u201cto create jobs in the kinds of places that I grew up in\u201d and what he called the need to \u201cstand up for\u201d American businesses.   Such comments ring hollow to some former\u00a0AppHarvest\u00a0workers, who argue Vance\u2019s rhetoric as a candidate for vice president doesn\u2019t align with the reality they experienced.   \u201cMaking the decision to go to work at\u00a0AppHarvest, like many of us made, the livelihood just went right down the drain,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI blame all of the original investors.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Tim Walz is facing scrutiny over his military service record, with critics, including his Republican rival Sen. JD Vance, accusing Walz of falsely suggesting he saw combat during his time as an Army reservist.   It\u2019s not the first time Walz has encountered such criticism.   Related article Trump team targets Walz and his military record in attempt to slow down Harris   A CNN KFile review reveals that similar accusations were made in 2006, during Walz\u2019s first run for Congress. That year, multiple letters to his local paper in Mankato, Minnesota, accused him of making misleading statements about his service, including whether he had served in Iraq or Afghanistan.   Walz found the accusations serious enough that he personally responded to them both.   At issue were a selection of political ads and statements on Walz\u2019s website describing his overseas military service. While they described Walz as having served overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, they neglected to specify that he did so while serving in Italy, not Afghanistan.   Walz was more specific in other statements and interviews with the media from 2006, in which he did say that, \u201cby luck of the draw,\u201d he was posted to Italy, and not Afghanistan.   Recent scrutiny of Walz\u2019s service record renewed after the Harris campaign posted a video of Walz speaking about his decision to change his position and support an assault weapons ban following the 2018 Parkland shooting.\u00a0In the video, Walz states, \u201cWe can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\u201d   In 2006, Walz heavily leaned into his brand as a soldier, focusing on his military service and teaching career to portray him as an everyman.\u00a0But Walz never explicitly said he faced combat.   Walz\u2019s official 2006 campaign biography read, \u201cPrior to retiring, Walz served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom,\u201d and his website\u2019s front page prominently featured him in military uniform.   Related video \u2018They\u2019re lying\u2019: Man who served with Walz responds to claims about his military record   One TV advertisement called Walz \u201cthe soldier who served for two decades but ready when they attacked,\u201d with an image of the Twin Towers burning on the front page of a newspaper.   The ad said he was a \u201ccommand sergeant major, retiring four years late after a tour supporting the war in Afghanistan,\u201d over an image of a newspaper article headline reading, \u201cTroops welcomed home,\u201d with a photo of Walz\u00a0saluting on his local paper the New Ulm Journal.   Another ad attacked his opponent for not voting for pay increases for soldiers and voting\u00a0to raise the salary of members of Congress.   \u201cWhen we deployed many in my unit took a pay cut,\u201d Walz said in another ad. \u201cHe gives himself a pay raise, but he tells the soldiers no.\u201d   Endorsements on his official website, including from retired Gen. Wesley Clark and former Sen. John Kerry, noted his military experience.   Walz was deployed between 2003 and 2004 to Europe to support Operation Enduring Freedom, but was never deployed to Afghanistan, where the operation occurred.   In 2006, the Walz campaign\u2019s description of his service drew pushback in separate letters to the editors.   One letter to his local paper said the Walz campaign\u2019s phrasing suggested service in Iraq or Afghanistan.   \u201cIt strongly suggests that he fought in Iraq or Afghanistan, but does not say which country,\u201d read the letter archived online here from July 2006. \u201cBecause the information is not classified, Walz can tell the voters where he deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan and his BOG (boots on the ground) dates. If Walz did not deploy downrange, he should say so.\u201d   The letter caused a string of letters in support of Walz.   \u201cI was wondering when the Republicans would start \u2018swift boating\u2019 Tim Walz,\u201d read one. \u201cTim Walz has never lied about his service. I have heard him speak several times, and he always explains that the battalion he led was sent to Italy during Operation Enduring Freedom to provide support to the U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan.\u201d   Walz himself personally responded.   \u201cOn Saturday The Free Press printed a letter which implied I embellished my military record. The details of my record can be easily found in numerous articles by The Free Press and other newspapers. Therefore, I must assume that the letter is meant to slander my good name,\u201d wrote Walz.   \u201cFor the record, I served 24 years in the Army National Guard and retired as a command sergeant major in May of 2005. I served in three NATO training missions to the Arctic and deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, serving in Italy in 2003-2004,\u201d he said.   \u201cUsing innuendo to defame a candidate\u2019s character has no place in this debate,\u201d he added. \u201cThis nation must do better because we have too many important issues facing us to do anything less.\u201d   One person who wrote a letter supporting Walz was Sgt. Ryan Marti, a former member of Walz\u2019s battery who was deployed in Iraq at the time. Marti said members of his unit were extremely supportive and glad to see Walz run for Congress.   \u201cIn 2003, we were stationed in Italy at the beginning of the Iraq invasion,\u201d Marti told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019d been serving since I think he was 17 when he joined up. \u2026 An opportunity that he never planned for came up to do something bigger. No one in the unit felt bad about this. I mean, a lot of us were extremely happy, and a lot of the teachers at school were happy.\u201d   Walz accurately described his service in an interview that year with the Minneapolis-St. Paul City Pages in June 2006.   \u201cI did 10 months with Operation Enduring Freedom, where, by luck of the draw, I served in Italy. It was originally Turkey or Iraq and then they changed it to Enduring Freedom and I said, \u2018That\u2019s Afghanistan.\u2019 But they said, \u2018You guys are going to do the supply lines between Turkey and England.\u2019 We provided total base security and the training for soldiers coming in,\u201d he said.   In November 2006, the same allegation was leveled at Walz.   \u201cThrough artful omission, Walz is leaving the impression that he served in the combat zones of the current conflict,\u201d read another letter to the editor in a local paper in November 2006.\u00a0 \u201cThe truth is that he served in Italy. There is a significant difference between Walz\u2019 garrison service in Italy and the extreme danger young men and women are facing in the combat zones of Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d   Walz again responded.   \u201cI am writing in response to Tom Hagen\u2019s lies about my service record,\u201d Walz wrote at the time. \u201cMy biography on my official campaign website simply states that \u2018prior to retiring, Walz served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\u2019\u201d   \u201cFrom this, Mr. Hagen makes the ridiculous claim that I am misleading voters that I served in combat in Iraq. After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress,\u201d he added.   \u201dI\u2019m proud of the 24 years I served our country in the Army National Guard. There\u2019s a code of honor among those who\u2019ve served, and normally this type of partisan political attack comes only from one who\u2019s never worn a uniform,\u201d he added. \u201cMr. Hagen, if you were confused about my service, you could have checked my Web site, or simply had the decency to call and ask me. When you dishonor a veteran, you dishonor all soldiers and veterans. You owe an apology to all those who serve honorably.\u201d   CNN\u2019s Danya Gainor and Allison Gordon contributed to this report.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, repeatedly indicated in 2016 that he believed Donald Trump had committed sexual assault, even suggesting in one TV segment that in a \u201che said, she said\u201d situation Trump was less credible than one of his accusers.   Vance appeared on a MSNBC segment in October 2016 on Trump\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct in which an interview with Jessica Leeds, a former salesperson who accused\u00a0 Trump of groping and forcibly kissing her during a flight in the 1970s, was played. Vance said it was hard to believe Trump\u2019s denials over Leeds.   \u201cAt a fundamental level, this is sort of a \u2018he said, she said,\u2019 right? And at the end of the day, do you believe Donald Trump, who always tells the truth? Just kidding,\u201d said Vance sarcastically. \u201cOr do you believe that woman on that tape?\u201d he said, referring to Leeds.   But by May 2023, in a sign of his shift on Trump from open critic to fiercely loyal surrogate, Vance\u2019s position changed entirely while invoking similar language: Vance said he believed his \u201cfriend\u201d Trump, just after the former president was found liable by a jury for sexual abuse against author E. Jean Carroll.   \u201cI think fundamentally the lawsuit is about something that happened 25 years ago. It\u2019s a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 situation. And I trust my friend and the guy that I\u2019ve known and gotten to know,\u201d the Ohio Republican told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, about six months after winning his US Senate race with Trump\u2019s endorsement.   Vance then suggested that the lawsuit, and the people funding it, was not about justice but about politics. \u201cThey are trying to take him down for political reasons. That, to me, is not about justice, that\u2019s not about discovering the truth. That\u2019s about using the legal system instead of the political system to win a debate against Donald Trump.\u201d   A spokesperson for Vance told CNN, \u201cJD\u2019s tweets and comments about President Trump from nearly a decade ago are old news that have been addressed numerous times since he entered the political world. They don\u2019t reflect his views on President Trump today and haven\u2019t for many years.\u201d   Trump has repeatedly denied claims of sexual assault.   Vance\u2019s defense of Trump marked a striking shift from his remarks in 2016 in the wake of the leak of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, which showed the Republican presidential candidate making lewd and sexually aggressive remarks about women.   In October 2016, Vance tweeted, \u201cWhat percentage of the American population has @realDonaldTrump sexually assaulted?\u201d   The tweet, which was first reported in 2018, was later deleted, but its replies still exist on the platform, and the tweet was later compiled in an opposition report published by his own super PAC in 2022 to uncover his potential vulnerabilities as a candidate.   In deleted likes from his Twitter account, reviewed by CNN, Vance had also indicated he believed Trump\u2019s accusers and those who criticized Trump as a \u201cserial sexual assault[er].\u201d   \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d read the post, again posted just after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced.   Another post liked in 2016 by Vance said, \u201cI wish there was a 2nd Vice Presidential debate just to see @GovPenceIN deny that Trump said he grabbed p*ssy.\u201d   And in October 2016, Vance shared on Facebook a Washington Post editorial by Russell Moore, then of the Southern Baptist Convention, criticizing Trump\u2019s views on women.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Vance once liked tweets harshly critical of Trump | CNN Politics": " Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a leading candidate to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president, liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration.   Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 something Vance now defends Trump over.   Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump stances have been well-documented, but these new examples, unearthed by an extensive review of Vance\u2019s past social media activity, demonstrate they were more widespread and scathing than previously known.   Their discovery also comes as Vance has solidified his standing in Trump\u2019s inner circle as a frequent defender of the former president and is among a handful of people under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick.   As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance once\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019 in February 2016, and a few months later wrote in The Atlantic that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d   Vance also said he even contemplated voting for Clinton, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president in 2016.   Once regarded as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the aggrieved White working class and a self-described \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance shot to fame over his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d published in June 2016. Vance was a frequent guest on cable news programs and later became a CNN contributor in 2017.   His subsequent transition from vocal Trump critic to staunch supporter has been widely scrutinized. Vance has become a key surrogate for the former president and routinely defends Trump on television, including during his hush money trial in New York last month. Vance also helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s June 6 fundraiser in San Francisco with tech industry donors. Trump is expected to meet with congressional Republicans in Washington, DC, on Thursday.   In a statement to CNN, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d and claimed that realizing the \u201ccorporate media and Deep State\u2019s\u201d coordinated efforts to undermine Trump changed his perspective.   \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d   Prior to the publication of this story, Vance\u2019s communications director sent along two supportive statements from Donald Trump Jr. and Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign.   Trump Jr. criticized news outlets for repeatedly covering Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump comments writing, \u201cWe\u2019re 100% confident that JD is America First to the core\u201d and \u201cno one in the Senate has been a stronger supporter of my father.\u201d Trump Jr. added they were \u201clong past all of this,\u201d saying they had \u201cdiscussed it with him at length.\u201d   Miller wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that politics is ultimately politics,\u201d and likened Vance\u2019s past criticism to criticism by Kamala Harris of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary over his past opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s.   In an interview published Thursday, Vance told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat about his political conversion to a pro-Trump Republican.   \u201cLike a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,\u201d Vance said.   CNN reviewed Vance\u2019s past likes on Twitter, the platform now known as X, before X changed its policy to make users\u2019 likes private and hidden from others.   A majority of the newly uncovered social media activity dates from the last five months of the 2016 presidential campaign. They include Vance liking a number of anti-Trump posts on Twitter, including those criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policies, acknowledging antisemitism from Trump supporters, questioning the integrity of voting for Trump over Clinton and even raising concerns over Trump having access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes as president.   In February 2016, Vance liked a tweet featuring a photo of Trump, two women and O.J. Simpson with the caption, \u201cHere is an old picture of one of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs. Also in picture: OJ Simpson.\u201d   Vance also liked tweets from August 2016 that praised his book and envisioned a role for him in a potential Clinton administration and another tweet suggesting he could provide Clinton with the \u201cseeds to a plan to defeat Trump.\u201d But Vance soon began liking several tweets with the hashtag #NeverHillary through October 2016.   While promoting his memoir and appearing on news programs in 2016, Vance liked a series of tweets calling then-candidate Trump a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cnemesis of the GOP.\u201d He also liked a tweet acknowledging \u201cthreats and derogatory terms Trump supporters hurl at Jews.\u201d He even liked a tweet from CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticizing Trump\u2019s tweet about a woman\u2019s appearance amidst then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s campaign against cyberbullying.   He also liked a tweet that read, \u201cDoes any dad (or future dad) want to look his daughter in the eye and explain why he voted for Trump instead of 1st woman president?\u201d   Among the harshest tweets Vance liked was one that called out Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, capturing previously unaired lewd and sexually aggressive remarks by the presidential nominee. \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d the tweet read.   Other tweets Vance engaged with criticized signature Trump policies, including Trump\u2019s hardline position on immigration and the tax cuts from 2017.   In August 2017, Vance criticized Trump\u2019s response to the White supremacist violence in Charlottesville earlier that year, linking in a since-deleted tweet to a TV segment that called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d for his response, and then liked a tweet indicating he did not consistently support the GOP or Trump.   \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance wrote, while also criticizing left-wing violence.   \u201cYou may not like @JDVance1\u2019s view - but it\u2019s hard to pin him down as consistently supporting views of either Trump or GOP,\u201d read the tweet Vance liked.   Despite his earlier harsh criticism of Trump, by 2021, Vance dismissed left-wing condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 where Trump equated White nationalist protestors and counter-protestors as \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d\u2014 as \u201cthe ridiculous race hoax in Charlottesville.\u201d   Ahead of his Senate campaign that year, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible,\u201d in tweets first uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile.   \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president.   In a previously unreported blog post Vance wrote in April 2010 under his previous legal name, J.D. Hamel, he wrote in support of legal immigration, advocating to \u201cmassively increase\u201d the number of migrants allowed into the country.   \u201cBorder security is a good start, but if we plan to control the border, then we must also plan to massively increase the number of legal migrants allowed into the country,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe day that America no longer welcomes decent, hardworking foreign nationals is the day that our nation loses something very central to its character and its economic diversity.\u201d   Vance told CNN, \u201cIt was a stupid opinion from 15 years ago when I was in my twenties. All anyone needs to do is check my voting record as a Senator to see that I have consistently opposed increased immigration levels into America.\u201d   Vance said in September 2016 that Trump\u2019s immigration policies were overly simplistic.   \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d   Three months ago, Vance reiterated his support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In an interview on Fox Business Vance said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of the southern border \u2013 tens of millions of illegal aliens are now in our country, tons of fentanyl killing over 100,000 people \u2013 we don\u2019t have a country anymore if we don\u2019t get control of that border.\u201d   This story has been updated with more information.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

The\u00a0articles were written with\u00a0the use of\u00a0artificial\u00a0intelligence.   The outlet,\u00a0Hoodline,\u00a0is not the first or only\u00a0news site\u00a0to\u00a0harness\u00a0AI. News organizations across the world are grappling with how to take advantage of the\u00a0rapidly developing technology, while also not being overrun by it.   But experts warn that relying too heavily on AI could wreck\u00a0the\u00a0credibility\u00a0of news organizations and potentially supercharge the spread of misinformation if not kept in close check. Media companies integrating AI in news publishing have also seen it backfire, resulting in public embarrassments. Tech outlet CNET\u2019s AI-generated articles made embarrassing factual errors. The nation\u2019s largest newspaper chain owner, Gannett, pulled back on an AI experiment reporting on high school sports games after public mockery. Sports Illustrated deleted several articles from its website after they were found to have been published under fake author names.   Hoodline,\u00a0founded in 2014 as a San Francisco-based hyper-local news outlet\u00a0with a mission\u00a0\u201cto cover the\u00a0news deserts\u00a0that no one else is covering,\u201d\u00a0once employed a newsroom full of\u00a0human journalists.\u00a0The outlet has since expanded into a national network of local websites, covering news and events in major cities across the country and drawing millions of readers each month, the company said.   But last year, Hoodline began filling its site with AI-generated articles. A disclaimer page linked at the bottom of its pages notes to readers,\u00a0\u201cWhile AI may assist in the background, the essence of our journalism \u2014 from conception to publication \u2014 is driven by real human insight and discretion.\u201d   Zachary Chen,\u00a0chief executive of\u00a0Hoodline parent company Impress3, which\u00a0acquired the site in 2020, defended the\u00a0site\u2019s\u00a0use of AI and its\u00a0transparency with readers, telling CNN the\u00a0outlet\u00a0provides valuable reporting in\u00a0news deserts\u00a0around the country\u00a0and is generating revenue to hire more\u00a0human\u00a0journalists\u00a0in the future.   Hoodline\u2019s staff includes \u201cdozens of editors, as well as dozens of journalist researchers, full time,\u201d Chen said. The outlet also employs a \u201cgrowing number of on-the-ground journalists who research and write original stories about their neighborhood beats,\u201d\u00a0he added, referencing\u00a0recent articles about restaurants,\u00a0retail\u00a0stores and events\u00a0in the\u00a0San Francisco\u00a0area.   But until recently, the site had further blurred the line between reality and illusion. Screenshots captured last year by\u00a0the Internet Archive and local outlet Gazetteer\u00a0showed Hoodline had\u00a0further embellished its AI author bylines with\u00a0what appeared to be AI-generated headshots resembling real people and fake biographical information.   \u201cNina is a long-time writer and a Bay Area Native who writes about good food & delicious drink, tantalizing tech & bustling business,\u201d one biography claimed.   The\u00a0fake headshots and biographies\u00a0have since\u00a0been removed from the\u00a0site,\u00a0replaced with a small \u201cAI\u201d badge next to\u00a0each\u00a0machine-assisted\u00a0article\u2019s byline, though they still carry\u00a0human\u00a0names. The archived screenshots have also been wiped from much of the internet. Wayback Machine director Mark Graham told CNN\u00a0that archived pages of Hoodline\u2019s AI writers were removed last month \u201cat the request of the rights holder of the site.\u201d   Chen acknowledged the company requested that the archive\u2019s screenshots of the site be removed from the internet, saying\u00a0\u201csome websites have taken outdated screenshots from months or even years ago to mischaracterize our present-day practices.\u201d   But experts expressed alarm over Hoodline\u2019s practices, warning that\u00a0it\u00a0exemplifies the potential pitfalls and perils of using AI in journalism, threatening to diminish public trust in news.   The way the site uses and discloses AI purposely tricks readers by \u201cmimicking\u201d the look and feel of a \u201cstandards-based local news organization with real journalists,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Peter Adams, a senior vice president of the News Literacy Project, which aims to\u00a0educate the public on identifying credible information.   \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of flagrantly opaque way to dupe people into thinking that they\u2019re reading actual reporting by an actual journalist who has a concern for being fair, for being accurate, for being transparent,\u201d Adams\u00a0told CNN.   The small \u201cAI\u201d badge\u00a0that now appears\u00a0next to fake\u00a0author personas on the site is \u201can empty gesture toward transparency rather than actually exercising transparency,\u201d Adams\u00a0added.   Chen\u00a0would\u00a0not disclose what AI system Hoodline\u00a0is employing, only calling it \u201cour own proprietary and custom-built software, combined with the most cutting-edge AI partners to craft publish-ready, fact-based article.\u201d Each article, Chen said, is overseen by editors before it is published.   Gazetteer previously reported that at least two\u00a0Hoodline\u00a0employees said\u00a0on LinkedIn\u00a0that they\u00a0were based in the Philippines,\u00a0far from the US cities that the outlet purports to cover.\u00a0Chen\u00a0did not respond to CNN\u2019s\u00a0question\u00a0about its staff or where they are located.   The\u00a0News/Media\u00a0Alliance, which represents more than 2,200 US publishers, has supported\u00a0news organizations\u00a0taking legal action against AI developers who are harvesting\u00a0news\u00a0content without permission.\u00a0Danielle Coffey,\u00a0the\u00a0group\u2019s chief executive, told CNN that Hoodline\u2019s content \u201cis likely a violation of copyright law.\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s another example of stealing our content without permission and without compensation to then turn around and compete with the original work,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cWithout quality news in the first place, this type of content among other practices will become unsustainable over time, as quality news will simply disappear.\u201d   Related article How a likely AI-generated image of Gaza took over the internet   Chen told CNN he takes copyright\u00a0law\u00a0very seriously and that\u00a0the outlet has\u00a0\u201cgreatly refined processes with heavy guardrails.\u201d\u00a0The site\u2019s readers, he asserted,\u00a0\u201cappreciate the unbiased nature of our AI-assisted news,\u201d and claimed Hoodline\u2019s visitor traffic has soared twentyfold since the publication was acquired. (Chen did not specify their traffic numbers.)   That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a place for AI in a newsroom. It can\u00a0assist journalists\u00a0in research and data processing and\u00a0reduce costs\u00a0in an industry\u00a0struggling\u00a0with tighter budgets.\u00a0Some news organizations, like News Corp., are increasingly inking lucrative partnerships with AI developers like OpenAI\u00a0to help bolster its large language models\u2019 knowledge base.   But Hoodline\u2019s use of\u00a0machine-written articles under seemingly human names is not the way to do it, said Felix Simon,\u00a0a\u00a0research fellow in AI and digital news at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford.   \u201cEmploying AI to help local journalists save time so they can focus on doing more in-depth investigations is qualitatively different from churning out a high amount of low-quality stories that do nothing to provide people with timely and relevant information about what is happening in their community, or that provides\u00a0them with a better understanding of how the things happening around them will end up affecting them,\u201d Simon told CNN.   Research conducted by Simon\u00a0and\u00a0Benjamin Toff, a journalism professor at the University of Minnesota, has also found that the public has not embraced the use of AI in news reporting.   \u201cWe found that people are somewhat less trusting of news labelled as AI, and there is reason to believe that people won\u2019t be as willing to pay for news generated purely with AI,\u201d he said.   On\u00a0Hoodline\u2019s\u00a0network of local news sites, it is difficult to find an article not written by the software.\u00a0Much of the\u00a0site\u2019s content\u00a0appears to be\u00a0rewritten\u00a0directly from press releases,\u00a0social media postings\u00a0or aggregated from\u00a0other news organizations.\u00a0Chen\u00a0said the outlet aims to\u00a0\u201calways provide proper attribution\u201d and follow \u201cfair use\u201d practices.   \u201cLocal news has been on a terrible downward trend for two decades, and as we expand, Hoodline is able to bring local stories that provide insight into what\u2019s going on at a hyper-local level, even in so-called \u2018news deserts,\u2019\u201d Chen said.   The outlet, which is profitable,\u00a0Chen said, plans to hire more human journalists as the company looks\u00a0to\u00a0evolve\u00a0its\u00a0current AI personas into \u201cAI news anchors delivering stories in short-form videos.\u201d The plan will make use of the fake bylines published on the site, eventually turning them into AI news readers, he said.   \u201cIt would not make sense for an AI news anchor to be named \u2018Hoodline San Francisco\u2019 or \u2018Researched by Person A & Edited by Persona B.\u2019 This is what we are building toward,\u201d Chen said.   Nuala Bishari,\u00a0a former Hoodline reporter,\u00a0wrote in\u00a0a recent column\u00a0for the San Francisco Chronicle that seeing her old job replaced by AI is \u201csurreal.\u201d   \u201cOld-fashioned shoe-leather reporting has been replaced by fake people who\u2019ve never set foot in any of the neighborhoods they write about \u2014 because they don\u2019t have feet,\u201d Bishari wrote.   But the transformation at Hoodline shows that bigger solutions are needed to keep vital local news reporting alive.   \u201cWithout a big shift, journalism as we know it will continue to sputter out,\u201d she wrote.\u201cAnd it isn\u2019t just tiny outlets like Hoodline that are in danger of going extinct or being zombified by AI.\u201d  Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Scroll through the posts below to read more about what happened on Friday.   Here are the takeaways from day 11 of the Trump hush money trial:   Hicks describes the tape \u201ccrisis\u201d and denying Daniels\u2019 allegations: After sitting in the witness box, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign press secretary and White House communications director\u00a0Hope Hicks looked visibly uncomfortable and quickly acknowledged as much when she began answering questions. \u201cI\u2019m really nervous,\u201d she said.   Much of Hicks\u2019 testimony focused on her role in the Trump campaign in October 2016, just before Election Day. Prosecutors asked what happened when the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape came out. \u201cThe tape was damaging. This was a crisis,\u201d Hicks said.   The aftermath of the tape then informed how the campaign responded when the\u00a0Wall Street Journal reported\u00a0on Karen McDougal\u2019s deal with American Media, Inc.\u00a0not to speak about an alleged affair as part of a $150,000 agreement   In the WSJ story, which also mentioned Daniels, Hicks, then a Trump campaign spokesperson, denied that Trump had had affairs with either woman. \u201cWhat I told to the Wall Street Journal is what was told to me,\u201d Hicks said of the denial she gave about the Daniels allegations.   When prosecutors finished with their questions and Trump\u2019s attorney took the podium, Hicks began crying and appeared to\u00a0become\u00a0overwhelmed. She finished her testimony after a brief break.   When cross-examining Hicks, Trump attorney Emil Bove elicited testimony that Trump was also concerned about what his wife would think. Trump asked for the newspapers not to be delivered to his residence the day the story was published, Hicks testified.   Jurors hear how Trump responded to \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape: Jurors saw a full transcript of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tap\ufeffe Friday, including Trump\u2019s infamous \u201cgrab \u2018em by the p*ssy\u201d comment, as well as other vulgar language the campaign tried to dismiss as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d They did not, however, hear Trump on the tape, as the judge ruled the video would be prejudicial\u00a0to the jury.   Prosecutors are getting closer to the crime: For two weeks, prosecutors have delved deeply into the negotiations that led to hush money payments made to McDougal and Daniels before the 2016 election. But those payments are not illegal on their own. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records stemming from how he allegedly hid the way Cohen was reimbursed for paying $130,000 to Daniels in order to keep her quiet before the 2016 election. With Hicks\u2019 testimony, prosecutors nudged closer to the repayment and the alleged charges.   Attacks continue against Michael Cohen: Trump\u2019s legal team continued its trial-long assault on Michael Cohen\u2019s credibility Friday, going after everything from the\u00a0way he\u00a0handled his cell phones to how he would go \u201crogue\u201d during the 2016 campaign.   Former President Donald Trump paid his $9,000 fine on Thursday for violating the gag order in his hush money criminal trial, according to a court official.   The fine was paid in two cashier\u2019s checks \u2013 one for $2,000 and one for $7,000 at the court clerk\u2019s office.   Judge Juan Merchan fined Trump $9,000 this week for violating his gag order nine times.\u00a0He gave him until the end of the business Friday to pay it.   Merchan has yet to rule on the prosecution\u2019s allegations of four additional gag order violations by Trump, after hearing arguments Thursday morning.   The third week of court proceedings in Donald Trump\u2019s historic hush money criminal trial wrapped on Friday.   To refresh your memory, here are the key moments and witnesses from the trial so far:   April 15: Trial began with jury selection.   April 19: A panel of 12 jurors and six alternates was selected.   April 22: The prosecution and defense made their opening statements. Former tabloid boss David Pecker was called to testify.   April 23: Judge Juan Merchan held a Sandoval hearing for Trump\u2019s alleged gag order violations, but reserved his decision.   April 25: While Trump sat in the Manhattan courtroom, the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., heard arguments on the matter of his immunity in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion case against him.   April 26: Pecker\u2019s direct questioning and cross-examination concluded. Trump\u2019s former longtime assistant Rhona Graff was called to testify briefly. Finally, Michael Cohen\u2019s former banker Gary Farro testified.   April 30: Farro\u2019s testimony concluded. Prosecutors then called Dr. Robert Browning, the executive director of C-SPAN archives, and Philip Thompson who works for a court reporting company.\u00a0Then, Keith Davidson, the former attorney for Daniels and McDougal, took the stand.   May 2: Davidson\u2019s testimony concluded. Digital evidence analyst Douglas Daus was called to testify.   May 3: After Daus finished testifying, Georgia Longstreet, a paralegal at the district attorney\u2019s office, spoke about reviewing Trump\u2019s social media posts for this case. She was followed by Hope Hicks, once a longtime Trump aide. Her highly anticipated testimony was a little less than three hours.   The hush money criminal trial against former President Donald Trump is one of\u00a0four criminal cases\u00a0he faces while juggling his presidential campaign.   The former president faces at least\u00a088 charges\u00a0over the four criminal indictments in Georgia, New York, Washington, DC, and Florida. Trump has pleaded not guilty to every charge in these cases.   Here\u2019s a recap of each case:   Read more about\u00a0the four criminal cases\u00a0Trump faces.   Donald Trump\u2019s former close confidante Hope Hicks continued to testify after the court returned from its lunch break on Friday.   Overall, she spoke for a little less than three hours and her testimony wrapped before the court adjourned for the day.   Here\u2019s everything you need to know about what she said:   On the Wall Street Journal story: After lunch, prosecutors resumed their questions around a\u00a0November, 4, 2016, WSJ article, which reported that the National Enquirer had paid Karen McDougal for the story of her alleged affair with Trump, but had not published the story.   2018 story about hush money to Stormy Daniels: Prosecutors showed the jury and the court the Wall Street Journal story from 2018 about the hush money payment.   Tearing up: Hicks started tearing up after the direct examination finished and as Trump\u2019s attorney Emil Bove took the podium. She was audibly sniffling and left the courtroom briefly.   Cross-examination: When she returned to the stand, she told Bove that she felt she had Trump\u2019s \u201ctrust and respect.\u201d   .   Donald Trump\u2019s legal team is led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, two former federal prosecutors from New York, and Susan Necheles, a veteran criminal defense lawyer with deep experience in New York and with appearing before Judge Juan Merchan.   Here are the key things to know about Trump\u2019s legal team:   Hope Hicks, once one of Trump\u2019s most trusted aides, testified today for a little under three hours.   She was called to the stand after Georgia Longstreet, a paralegal at the district attorney\u2019s office, testified about reviewing Trump\u2019s Twitter account as well as thousands of social media posts for this case.   The New York district attorney\u2019s office has \u201cbeen after us for years,\u201d Donald Trump said as he left the Manhattan courtroom after the day\u2019s proceedings wrapped.   \u201cThey\u2019ve destroyed people\u2019s lives,\u201d Trump added, saying people have to lawyer up and have no time left to do anything. He called it a \u201cshame.\u201d   Trump did not go into specifics, but said he \u201cwas very interested in what took place today.\u201d   After giving a political speech, Trump ended with: So, I just want to wish everybody a good weekend.\u201d   Court is now adjourned, after the attorneys from each side discussed guidelines for topics that could be raised if Trump chooses to testify in his defense later in the trial.   \u201cHave a good weekend,\u201d Judge Juan Merchan said, after ruling in favor of a request from Trump\u2019s legal team not to allow prosecutors to ask questions about violating the former president\u2019s gag order.   Judge Juan Merchan has ruled in favor of a defense argument that it would be too prejudicial for the jury to hear about the contempt order he issued over Donald Trump violating a gag order.   He also denied the prosecution\u2019s ability to cross-examine the former president about the gag order if he chooses to testify in his defense.   Prosecutors said earlier this week they wanted to ask Trump about the judge\u2019s ruling that Trump violated the gag order.   Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said asking Trump about the gag order violations was \u201cappropriate and allowable\u201d Sandoval evidence.   Merchan however said he agrees with Trump\u2019s attorney Todd Blanche and won\u2019t let the prosecutors ask about the violations.   \u201cFor a jury to hear that this court \u2013 the same judge that\u2019s presiding over this case \u2013 has found Mr. Trump to be in contempt, on this case, I think would just be so prejudicial.\u201d   Some context: A Sandoval hearing involves an examination of the defendant\u2019s criminal history. It is required under New York law when a defendant plans to testify in their own trial and is meant as an indicator of whether it would be a good idea for them to take the stand.   Donald Trump turned and nodded to Hope Hicks with a small smile when she passed the defense table.   Judge Juan Merchan has dismissed the jury for the day, saying:   \u201cAlright jurors. We\u2019re going to call it a week.\u201d   The jury has exited the courtroom.   After Hope Hicks cried on the stand, she took a brief break. When she returned, Donald Trump\u2019s defense attorney Emil Bove began the cross examination.   Bove\u2019s tone thus far was soft and nonconfrontational. He\u2019s ended nearly every question with \u201cright\u201d or \u201ccorrect,\u201d said CNN anchor and chief legal correspondent Laura Coates.   However, Bove\u2019s reputation is the opposite, noted CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz:   (H)e may be charming the jury, but his reputation from Southern District of New York (SDNY) had always been that he can come off quite harsh. The defense understands that choosing carefully who questions makes a difference \u2014 and they do have women on the team.   Hope Hicks is excused. Her testimony is over.   Judge Juan Merchan has called attorneys to the bench.   The cross-examination of Hope Hicks by Trump attorney Emil Bove is over.   Trump attorney Emil Bove is asking Hicks about how she testified that Trump didn\u2019t want the newspapers delivered to the residence on November 4, 2016, when the Wall Street Journal story on Karen McDougal came out.   \u201cThere were parts of this that were very personal to him, right?\u201d Bove asks.   \u201cAbsolutely. I don\u2019t think he wanted anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed by anything that was happening on the campaign trail. He wanted them to be proud of him,\u201d Hicks says.   Trump attorney Emil Bove clarified with Hope Hicks that when she mentioned hearing discussions on Trump\u2019s plane about Stormy Daniels years before the Wall Street Journal article in 2016, it was about Daniels relationship with football player\u00a0Ben Roethlisberger.   Attorney Emil Bove is asking Hope Hicks about when Trump\u2019s tax return data was leaked.   She says she also recalled campaign staff coming together to respond.   By the time Trump\u2019s lawyer Emil Bove began to cross-examine Hope Hicks, one of the key witnesses brought by the prosecution, she had become visibly emotional and had teared up on the witness stand.   In most trials, now would be the time for Trump\u2019s lawyers to undermine Hick\u2019s testimony to cast doubt on her credibility. But doing so now would risk turning the jury against him, one CNN legal analyst noted.   \u201cCross-examining a crying witness is something that can very quickly turn a jury off of an attorney, and Emil Bove has a very delicate needle to thread here. \u201d said Elliot Williams, a former federal prosecutor.   \u201cThey want to hit her hard and they want to push the points that she\u2019s made, but on a stylistic level, it\u2019s something that fraught with peril.\u201d     Defense attorney Emil Bove is asking Hope Hicks about whether Trump was concerned about how the Karen McDougal story would affect things at home.   \u201cPresident Trump really values Mrs. Trump\u2019s opinion, and she doesn\u2019t weigh in all the time, but when she does it\u2019s really meaningful to him and, you know, he really really respects what she has to say,\u201d Hicks says.   She says she does think Trump was concerned about what her \u201cperception\u201d would be.   Attorney Emil Bove asks Hope Hicks whether in her experience \u201cit\u2019s not uncommon\u201d for a campaign to work with the media?   Hicks smiled and answered, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have a job if that wasn\u2019t a regular practice.\u201d   The former president exchanged a look and a smirk with his other attorney, Todd Blanche, when she said this.   Hicks is sounding more composed now with her answers as Bove has her asking about her work experience.   Several jurors are looking down as the cross-examination continues.   Hope Hicks is testifying that then-Trump attorney Michael Cohen tried to \u201cinsert himself\u201d into the 2016 presidential campaign.   Hicks said Cohen \u201cwasn\u2019t supposed to be on the campaign in any official capacity.\u201d   Hicks says the attorney \u201cwasn\u2019t looped in on the day-to-day of campaign strategy,\u201d but he would go \u201crogue\u201d and take actions that were unauthorized by Trump\u2019s team, frustrating the campaign.   \u201cHe liked to call himself a fixer, or Mr. Fix It, and it was only because he first broke it that he was able to then fix it,\u201d she said.   Trump attorney Emil Bove is asking Hope Hicks about her relationship with Trump.   \u201cYou felt that you had his trust and respect?\u201d Bove asks.   \u201cHis trust and respect, yes,\u201d Hicks said, her voice still quivering.   Bove confirmed again that Rhona Graff had a similar\u00a0relationship of mutual respect. \u201cI really looked up to Rhona,\u201d Hicks said.   \u201cSorry about that,\u201d Hope Hicks says, as testimony resumes following a brief pause after the former Trump aide appeared to grow emotional.   \u201cIf you need a minute, just let me know,\u201d Trump attorney Emil Bove responds.   Hope Hicks is back on the stand. The bailiff is refilling her water cup.   The jury has also returned to the courtroom.   There\u2019s been a brief pause in the courtroom proceedings. The jury left the room.   Hope Hicks started tearing up after the direct examination finished and as Donald Trump\u2019s attorney Emil Bove took the podium.   As soon as Bove began, he asked her, \u201cI want to talk to you about your time at the Trump Organization.\u201d   Hicks appeared to have become overwhelmed by the moment.   She appeared to be trying to hold back tears and asked for a minute as she reached into her purse. Hicks was audibly sniffling with tears.   She left the courtroom with her attorney and the jury was led out.   As she left, Hicks moved her hair to one side of her neck, lowered her head and quickened her pace slightly as she passed Trump.   Trump remained seated the whole time.   Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asks Hope Hicks whether the idea that Michael Cohen made the $130,000 payment on his own was consistent with her interactions with him.   \u201cI\u2019d say that would be out of character for Michael,\u201d Hicks says.   Trump attorney Emil Bove will begin cross-examining Hope Hicks.   Hope Hicks says she was skeptical about Michael Cohen\u2019s motives for making the payment.   \u201cI didn\u2019t know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person,\u201d she says, noting that Cohen is \u201cthe kind of person who seeks credit.\u201d   Hicks said it was \u201cout of character\u201d for Cohen.   Defense attorney Todd Blanche is whispering in Trump\u2019s ear covering his mouth as Hope Hicks is testifying about how Trump communicated about the payment.   Trump nods and shrugs in response.   Matthew Colangelo asks Hope Hicks if, to her knowledge, Donald Trump communicated directly about the payment.   \u201cI only know about one instance\u2026sometime in the middle of February\u2026Mr. Trump told me about it.\u201d   The instance: The morning after Michael Cohen gave a statement to The New York Times that he had, in fact, made the payment without Trump\u2019s knowledge.   Prosecutors are showing the jury and the court the Wall Street Journal story from 2018 about the hush money payment and a statement from a \u201cWhite House official.\u201d   Hicks says she was not the White House official anonymously quoted in the story. \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure\u201d who it was, Hicks says, saying she believes it was Hogan Gidley, a former White House spokesperson.   Hicks is looking at a document presented to her to refresh her recollection about a conversation with then-Trump attorney Michael Cohen about the $130,000 hush money payment made to Stormy Daniels.   Cohen told Hicks that the story of the payment wasn\u2019t true, that no payment had been made, that no relationship had transpired, and that he had documentation to prove no payment had been made.   Hicks asked Trump how he would like the team to respond to the story.   Some context: It\u2019s not clear what document prosecutors showed Hicks to jog her memory \u2014 documents used solely for that purpose don\u2019t have to be shown to jurors because they don\u2019t have to be entered into evidence.   Hope Hicks says she spoke to Trump about the news coverage after Anderson Cooper\u2019s interview with Karen McDougal but doesn\u2019t remember speaking to Trump about David Pecker at that point.   Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asks about an interview Karen McDougal did with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. She was aware of the interview and watched the interview.   Hicks has no recollection of speaking to then-National Enquirer publisher David Pecker after that interview.   \u201cTo my knowledge \u2026 I did not speak to Mr. Pecker. I did speak to Mr. Trump,\u201d she said.   Hicks left the White House five days later, though she later rejoined.   The day Karen McDougal sued AMI, the publisher of the National Enquirer, Madeline Westerhaul texted Hope Hicks:   \u201cHey. The president wants to know if you called David Pecker again?\u201d   Hicks says she has no recollection of speaking to Pecker. She says she doesn\u2019t believe she called him but doesn\u2019t remember.   Judge Juan Merchan overruled an objection about a question regarding Hope Hicks\u2019 awareness Karen McDougal suing American Media Inc. to be released from her non-disclosure agreement.   Hicks didn\u2019t remember that independently, but said she recently had her memory refreshed about the lawsuit.   Madeleine Westerhout also sat in that area outside the Oval Office with Hope Hicks, she testifies.   Westerhout worked as Trump\u2019s executive assistant at the time.   Some context: Westerhout is expected as a potential witness later in this case.   Hope Hicks has turned to the jurors to explain what the outer Oval Office looks like at the White House.   She is describing directly to the jurors, making eye contact briefly.   She smiles slightly, and shifts her tone to informational and conversational. The jurors look directly at her.   \u201cIt\u2019s a very small space. Very small,\u201d she says of the area where she worked.   Hope Hicks was appointed Director of Strategic Communications when she joined the White House.   She worked closely with Trump on media opportunities and spoke regularly to him during that time, she testifies.   Eventually, Hicks says she became White House communications director.   Hope Hicks is now being asked about her time at the White House and Fox Corporation.   Hicks confirms she had a role on the presidential transition and then worked in the White House when Trump took office.   Asked whether the Wall Street Journal story would be an impact on Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Hicks says: \u201cEverything we talked about in the context of this time period and this time frame was about whether or not there was an impact on the campaign.\u201d   Noting how close to the 2016 election they were when the Wall Street Journal\u2019s reporting on Karen McDougal emerged, Hicks says the Trump campaign was just hoping to move forward.   \u201cThere was a lot going on, and you know, it wasn\u2019t like this story was consuming the news cycle and I needed to be aware of every little detail. I was kind of just hoping at this point we were going to just blow past it and keep going,\u201d she testifies.   Hope Hicks says she asked for David Pecker\u2019s number from Michael Cohen.   She had one but Donald Trump thought it was the wrong number.   Hicks wanted the number because Trump wanted to speak to the publisher of the National Enquirer, she said.   Hope Hicks says she discussed the article with Trump.   \u201cHe was concerned about the story. He was concerned about how it would be viewed by his wife, and he wanted me to make sure that the newspapers weren\u2019t delivered to his residence that morning,\u201d she says.   Michael Cohen texted Hope Hicks saying he had a statement from Stormy Daniels.   \u201cEven CNN not talking about it. No one believes it and if necessary, I have a statement by Storm denying everything and contradicting the other porn stars statement. I wouldn\u2019t use it now or even discuss it with him as no one is talking about this or cares!,\u201d Cohen said.   When asked about the text, Hicks said, \u201cI didn\u2019t follow up and say, \u2018what are you talking about, what statement.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know what he was talking about and I didn\u2019t want to know.\u201d   Hicks said of the coverage of the story, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t being picked up in the same way as the way the Access Hollywood tape was. It wasn\u2019t wall-to-wall coverage.\u201d   Trump is looking at the screen in front of him in the courtroom as Hope Hicks reads her 2016 text exchanges with then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.   Prosecutors questioned former Trump staffer Hope Hicks about a Wall Street Journal story that ran four days before the 2016 election and threw the campaign into crisis.   That story broke the news that the publisher of the National Enquirer agreed to pay $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her story about an alleged affair with Trump a decade earlier. The paper then declined to publish the story, a process known as \u201ccatch and kill.\u201d   At the time, Hicks told the Journal that the claim of the affair was \u201ctotally untrue.\u201d   Prosecutors are attempting to establish what was happening within Trump campaign headquarters in the hectic weeks before the election. The WSJ story ran just weeks after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, which caught Trump making lewd statements about women, was released.   Hope Hicks giggles and laughs when reading an ironic typo included in the text.   She eventually responded later that night, sending Michael Cohen the article from the Wall Street Journal.   \u201cPoorly written and I dot (sic) see it getting much play,\u201d Cohen had texted at 10:06 p.m.   Hicks said: \u201cI agree with most of that.\u201d   She added:   \u201cIt will get play bc the media is the worst but he should just ignore and blow past it. \u201c   The jury sees texts Michael Cohen sent to Hope Hicks with no response.   Hope Hicks is now reading through a catalog of texts between herself and Michel Cohen.   In her 2016 statement to the Wall Street Journal, Hicks is quoted as saying it was \u201cabsolutely, unequivocally\u201d untrue that Trump had a relationship with Daniels.   Asked in court if Trump told her to say that, Hicks replies, \u201cYes.\u201d   \u201cWhat I told to the Wall Street Journal is what was told to me,\u201d Hicks says of the denial she gave about the Daniels allegations.   The jurors are following along, reading the exhibits on screens in front of them. They look at the attorney for each question and then turn for her response.   Prosecutor is asking Hope Hicks to look at her grand jury testimony to see if it reminds her of what she told prosecutors previously.   Hick says \u201cthe denial was from Mr. Trump for both women, that\u2019s very clear.\u201d She adds that she doesn\u2019t have a specific memory of Trump telling her\u00a0\u201c\u2018say we have no knowledge of any of this.\u2019\u201d   \u201cThese are hectic conversations. There\u2019s a lot of people weighing in,\u201d Hicks explains.   Hope Hicks touches her chest and looks up as if trying to find the words when asked to quote Donald Trump or attribute his statements directly.   Hicks\u2019 body is turned towards the jury and she is angling her head towards the prosecutor when she speaks.   She is smiling nervously through her statements as she tries to explain that she can\u2019t remember verbatim statements.   Hope Hicks is now reading the denial she gave to the Wall Street Journal for the story.   At the time she told the reporter that the claim of the affair was \u201ctotally untrue.\u201d   Hicks is reluctant to quote or attribute anything to Donald Trump as verbatim.   Hicks said: \u201cI don\u2019t remember him saying to me verbatim, \u2018We have no knowledge of any of this.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to say that\u2019s what he said because I don\u2019t remember.\u201d   Prosecutors are now showing Hope Hicks and the jury the November 4, 2016, story from the Wall Street Journal.   She said Reince Priebus was in the car with her and Trump at the time of the call with Michael Cohen.   They were traveling to a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, she said.   Prosecutors have resumed their questions for key witness Hope Hicks, picking up a line of inquiries around a 2016 article in the Wall Street Journal about Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels.   \u201cI believe I heard Mr. Trump speaking to Mr. Cohen shortly after the story was published,\u201d Hicks testified.   Hicks, who has said she is nervous during the testimony, is wringing her hands as she says this.   \u201cThere was nothing memorable\u201d about the call, she said.   Remember: Before the break, the former Trump aide was testifying about the November, 4, 2016, article, which reported that the National Enquirer had paid McDougal for the story of her alleged affair with Donald Trump, but had not published the story.   The piece also referenced Daniels, and that she had abruptly cut off talks with ABC to share her own story. It highlighted that the same lawyer represented both women.   Attorney Todd Blanche was whispering to Donald Trump while Hope Hicks walked past in the courtroom.   Hope Hicks walked past Trump as she made her way back to the witness box.   She did not look in his direction. Her right hand was clenched in a fist, and her left was holding a handbag.   Trump looked up at her slightly as she stepped into the box.   Donald Trump walked down the center aisle of the courtroom and smirked at someone sitting on the left side of the galley.   Judge Juan Merchan is on the bench.   A nervous Hope Hicks, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign press secretary, took the stand and testified about her interactions with the former president, AMI chief David Pecker, and Michael Cohen before prosecutor Matthew Colangelo dove into the fallout surrounding the bombshell \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.   Hicks, the prosecution\u2019s ninth witness, testified for nearly 90 minutes before the lunch break.\u00a0She did not look at Trump for most of that time, glancing briefly at him during one line of inquiry about his social media behavior during the 2016 campaign, but otherwise keep her focus on the prosecutor and the jury, during her questioning. She confirmed she was testifying under subpoena. She has no professional relationship with him now.   Here\u2019s what she has said so far:   Trump organization is run like a family business: Hicks began testifying about the Trump Organization, which she claimed was run like a \u201ca small family business in certain ways\u201d despite being a \u201cbig and successful company.\u201d She added, \u201ceverybody that works there in some sense reports to Mr. Trump,\u201d whom she referred to as such for the duration of her testimony.   Hicks doesn\u2019t recall being at the Pecker-Trump meeting at Trump Tower   Hicks becomes aware of \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape: \u201cThis was a crisis\u201d   When Hicks first heard of Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels   Trump very involved in media responses throughout the campaign:\u00a0\u201cIt was just me and Mr. Trump who is better than anybody at communications and branding,\u201d she said. Hicks said Trump was \u201cvery involved\u201d in his campaign and weighed in on media responses. \u201cHe knew what he wanted to say and how he wanted to say it. We were all just following his lead. He deserves the credit for the different messages that the campaign focused on in terms of the agenda that he put forth,\u201d Hicks testified.   Hicks also testified that Trump posted all of his own tweets during the campaign, or a staffer would post things Trump personally approved. Tweets that were entered into court earlier in the day were reviewed by Hicks under her testimony. This includes Trump\u2019s attacks on the late Sen. John McCain and his denial of the allegations involving women.   CNN\u2019s Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report   During today\u2019s questioning of Hope Hicks, prosecutors have asked Donald Trump\u2019s former  aide about how he and his inner circle reacted to the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in October 2016.   This is one of several key moments that are central to the hush money case against Trump that Hicks has been asked about today.\u00a0Read up on CNN\u2019s timeline of events below:   See the full timeline.   Cameras are not allowed inside the Manhattan courtroom when proceedings are underway, but sketch artists are capturing the scenes from Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial.   Sketches from Friday show testimony from Hope Hicks, who was once one of Donald Trump\u2019s most trusted aides, and Douglas Daus, a digital evidence analyst who works for the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.   Hope Hicks, once a longtime trusted aide in Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle, is\u00a0testifying Friday in the New York hush money trial\u00a0after being subpoenaed.   \u201cI\u2019m really nervous,\u201d Hicks said while looking at the jury. She looked visibly uncomfortable after taking the stand.   As CNN reported previously,\u00a0Hicks appeared before the grand jury last year before Trump was indicted, as did Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway. Hicks was Trump\u2019s press secretary during the campaign and could shed light on what was happening inside the political operation in the final weeks before the 2016 election, as\u00a0Cohen\u00a0says he\u00a0was paying off\u00a0adult film star\u00a0Stormy Daniels to remain quiet about an alleged affair that Trump worried could upend his presidential campaign.   Trump\u00a0allegedly\u00a0reimbursed\u00a0Cohen after he took office\u00a0and has since been charged with\u00a034 counts of falsifying business records\u00a0to hide\u00a0the true nature of those payments. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair.   Hicks has a long shared history with Trump, starting with her time\u00a0working in communications for the Trump Organization\u00a0and was one of the first staffers to join his 2016 campaign. During Trump\u2019s presidency, Hicks eventually rose to become\u00a0White House communication director\u00a0and was one of the longest-lasting aides in a White House that was frequently marked by a series of acrimonious departures.   She thrived in an environment where loyalty was paramount, consistently defending Trump amid criticism, and the president\u00a0nicknamed her \u201cHopey.\u201d Hicks\u2019 proximity to Trump has at times put her under a media microscope.   Read more about Hicks and her relationship with Trump.   Hope Hicks, once part of the Trump inner circle, is testifying for the prosecution on the hectic time at his campaign after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was released in October 2016.   Here\u2019s what CNN analysts have had to say about her strength as a witness in the case.   Elie Honig, CNN senior legal analyst:   \u201cHope Hicks was the ultimate insider\u2026If and when she says something that\u2019s helpful for the prosecution\u2019s case, it\u2019s going to hit extra hard in favor of the prosecution because you can\u2019t say this is a person who has a gripe or a beef with Donald Trump.\u201d   Alyssa Farah Griffin, former Trump administration staffer:   \u201cI\u2019ve actually been skeptical that Hope Hicks makes a lot of sense for the prosecution \u2026Yes, Hope is a consummate Insider. She was very close to Donald Trump, especially in the first campaign. But this is a woman who is not partisan\u2026She is fiercely loyal to Donald Trump even after January 6.\u201d   Diane Kiesel, retired judge of the New York Supreme Court:   \u201cHope Hicks seems to be a likable witness \u2026 It will be very interesting to see how the defense handles her on cross-examination. A woman who walks into a courtroom and says \u2018I\u2019m really nervous to be here\u2019 \u2014 I don\u2019t know that they want to go after her very harshly. That could backfire.\u201d   Laura Coates, CNN chief legal analyst:   \u201cThis is a very significant witness. She hasn\u2019t spoken to him in two years. He\u2019s not paying for her attorney. She\u2019s there because of a subpoena \u2026This is not somebody the jury\u2019s going to say, \u2018Well, I guess there was $130,000 being paid out that he knew nothing about.\u2019 What I\u2019m waiting to hear from her though is, what came after the campaign? Why was there the concern still to pay and cover up or falsify a record? That\u2019s the key.\u201d   Trump did not react as Hope Hicks walked past him as she exited the courtroom for the lunch break. Defense attorney Todd Blanche was whispering in his ear.   Trump and lawyers are now leaving the courtroom.   The jury is leaving the courtroom, and court is breaking for lunch.   Hicks says a Wall Street Journal reporter told her on the phone that Stormy Daniels would also be mentioned in a forthcoming story about Karen McDougal.   She told Trump about it, and he \u201cwanted to know the context, and he wanted to make sure that there was a denial of any kind of relationship,\u201d Hicks testifies.   \u201cI felt the point of the story was that the National Enquirer paid a woman for her story and never published it,\u201d Hicks says.   \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily about accusations of, you know, certain behavior,\u201d she added, pausing slightly before finishing her sentence.   For context: The November 4, 2016, story references that McDougal lawyer Keith Davidson also represented Stormy Daniels, and that Daniels had been in discussion with ABC about potentially publicly disclosing her story.   The article said Daniels eventually cut off contact with the network without telling her story.   Hope Hicks testified that when she spoke with Donald Trump they called David Pecker.   \u201cHe wanted to hear that from David as well and so I believe I have a recollection of us calling and David repeating that to Mr. Trump and sometime after that conversation Mr. Trump wanted\u2026 he didn\u2019t want to use the statement that we had drafted \u2026.he wanted to craft his own statement,\u201d Hicks said.   The jury is seeing four draft responses Hope Hicks sent to Michael Cohen to review.   He responded: \u201cinstead\u2026say: These accusations are completely untrue and just the latest despicable attempt by the liberal media and the clinton machine to distract the public from the FBI\u2019s ongoing criminal investigation into secretary clinton and her closest associates.\u201d   Hope Hicks is describing a call with David Pecker, during which he explained the Karen McDougal deal.   \u201cI asked what was going on. Why was I receiving this email and he explained that Karen McDougal was paid for magazine covers and fitness columns and that it was all very legitimate and that was what the contract was for,\u201d Hicks said of her call with Pecker.   Hicks said she had \u201cnever\u201d had any discussions with Pecker before that date about McDougal.   Trump is less engaged with Hope Hicks\u2019 testimony now as she gets into the Karen McDougal questions, sitting back in his chair with his eyes closed.   Hope Hicks is testifying that she called Michael Cohen because she knew he had a relationship with David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer.   She also called Pecker\u2019s office, she says.   She says she thinks she called Cohen before Pecker, and he prompted her to call Pecker for more information.   \u201cMichael sort of feigned like he didn\u2019t know what I was talking about,\u201d she says.   Hope Hicks says she forwarded the Wall Street Journal email to Jared Kushner because of his role on the campaign and also because of his relationship with Rupert Murdoch.   Hicks says she hoped to \u201cbuy a little extra time.\u201d   Hope Hicks got the email about the Wall Street Journal story on Trump\u2019s plane as they were landing in Ohio for a rally, she said.   The email laid out the story about American Media Inc. buying Karen McDougal\u2019s story of an affair with Trump.   The WSJ reporter asked if Trump had an affair with McDougal and was he or anyone close to him aware of or involved in the contract between McDougal and AMI.   Hicks says she believed that she mentioned the email to Trump before his rally because she was worried she wouldn\u2019t have enough time to respond otherwise.   The email is being displayed for the jury and most jurors are looking at their monitor.   Hope Hicks says she had heard of Stormy Daniels one other time before Daniels was mentioned in the November 4, 2016, Wall Street Journal story.   Hicks says that security guys on Donald Trump\u2019s plane in 2015 were telling a story about a celebrity golf tournament and some of the participants, and Daniels\u2019 name came up.   Hope Hicks says she first heard of Karen McDougal on November 4, 2016, when contacted by the the Wall Street Journal.   Prosecutors are now showing Donald Trump\u2019s tweets they had introduced into evidence previously, including his attack on the late Sen. John McCain and his denial of the allegations involving women.   Hope Hicks is reading the tweets of Trump\u2019s denials.   Hope Hicks is now being asked about Trump\u2019s Twitter account. Twitter is now known as X.   Asked whether he considered it an important part of his campaign, she says \u201cdefinitely.\u201d   During the campaign, Trump posted all of his own tweets or a staffer would post things that Trump personally approved.   Prosecutors are now playing a video from a October 2016 rally in North Carolina where Trump denies these reports.   Asked if Trump was concerned these reports could hurt his standing with voters, Hicks replies, \u201cYes.\u201d   Hope Hicks, once considered one of\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s closest confidantes and most trusted aides, has been testifying about the moment the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape of Trump using crude terms to describe treatment of women was released in October 2016.   The October 9, 2016 debate, moderated by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and ABC News\u2019 Martha Raddatz, is now being discussed.   Hope Hicks says the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was raised during the debate as one of the first questions.   After the debate, Hicks confirms there were reports regarding Donald Trump\u2019s behavior with women.   The night after the debate, she says she was contacted by The New York Times. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo stops her from describing the story.   As Hope Hicks has continued to testify, Donald Trump has more frequently engaged with his attorneys.   He appears increasingly agitated as he fires off comments to his attorney Emil Bove and Todd Blanche with facial expressions.   Hope Hicks says she reached out to Michael Cohen to run down a rumor she had heard about another tape \u201cthat would be problematic for the campaign.\u201d   \u201cThere was no such tape, regardless, but he chased that down for me,\u201d Hicks says.   Judge Juan Merchan sustains the Trump team\u2019s objection.   Donald Trump was writing something on a notepad while Emil Bove and Todd Blanche were at the bench. He showed it to Bove when he returned.   Hope Hicks is looking at the jury and prosecutor as she testifies today.   She has not looked at Trump.   More on the jury: Jurors appear to be very attentive. They are following the questions.   There\u2019s been an objection, and attorneys are now at the judge\u2019s bench.   Donald Trump is leaning over and chatting with his attorney Susan Necheles while lawyers are at side bar.   Prosecutors put up Mitch McConnell\u2019s statement on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape on the screen.   Trump leaned in to look at the statement briefly.   Then, prosecutors showed Mitt Romney\u2019s statement. Trump slightly shook his head and did not look toward Romney\u2019s statement on the screen.   Hope Hicks is asked who released statements criticizing Donald Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.   She raises former House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Mitt Romney.   Trump bobbed his head when she said the Republican lawmakers\u2019 names.   Donald Trump is leaning back now with his eyes closed. His attorneys Emil Bove and Todd Blanche are passing notes between him.   Hope Hicks was just asked about the media coverage surrounding the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.   Hicks bit her lip and replied, \u201cIt was intense.\u201d   She said coverage of the tape knocked news of a category 4 hurricane out of the news cycle.   \u201clt was all Trump all the time for the next 36 hours,\u201d Hicks testified.   Prosecutors are now playing the video Trump released that evening for Hope Hicks.   She says she was present as the video was prepared.   Trump is engaged, watching Hicks on the screen and directly on the stand. He did appear to look at the statement on the monitor while it was shown to the jury.   Hicks is reading the initial campaign statement for the jury. It\u2019s also displayed on a screen in the courtroom.   \u201cThis was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course \u2013 not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended,\u201d the statement reads.   Trump was involved with the campaign response to the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, Hope Hicks testifies.   \u201cHe always liked to weigh in on responses,\u201d she says.   Hicks is shown a copy of the first statement the campaign put out on the tape. Trump leaned forward to look at the monitor in front of him as it was displayed.   Hope Hicks says Donald Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t want to offend anybody.\u201d   \u201cI think he felt like it was pretty standard stuff for two guys chatting with each other,\u201d she adds about the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.   Hope Hicks says that \u201cin that moment,\u201d she was not concerned about the impact the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape would have on female voters \u2014 but the concern crossed her mind maybe a few hours later or the next day.   \u201cCertainly, eventually, that was something that was raised,\u201d she says.   \u201cI was a little stunned,\u201d Hope Hicks said of her first reaction to watching the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.   Trump leaned over in the courtroom to his lawyer Todd Blanche to say something as she said this.   \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe, but it was definitely concerning. I had a good sense this was going to be a massive story,\u201d Hicks testified.   \u201cThis was a damaging development\u201d to the campaign, Hicks said.   She said there was consensus among the group: \u201cThe tape was damaging. This was a crisis.\u201d   Hope Hicks is recalling Trump\u2019s reaction to the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.   \u201cHe said that didn\u2019t sound like something he would say,\u201d Hicks says, noting Trump asked to see the actual tape.   Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asks if Donald Trump was upset when he saw the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.   \u201cYes. Yeah he was,\u201d hicks said.   Trump asked to see the actual tape, Hicks says. She adds she can\u2019t remember whether she saw the tape before the Washington Post published its story or not.   Hope Hicks says Trump\u2019s campaign team was on the 25th floor of Trump Tower in a conference room at the time, prepping for a debate.   She recalled Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Jared Kushner and Jason Miller were there with others at the time.   She recalls seeing Jeff Sessions that day but doesn\u2019t think he was in the conference room at that time.   Hope Hicks is reading over an email she sent with notes to several senior leaders of the Trump campaign after the Washington Post requested a comment about the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.   \u201cFLAGGING,\u201d Hicks wrote in the email, with two notes: \u201c1) Need to hear the tape, to be sure. 2) Deny, deny, deny.\u201d   On the stand, Hicks is rubbing her chin as she says, \u201cdeny, deny, deny.\u201d She confirmed she wrote this with a laugh, calling it a \u201creflex.\u201d   \u201cStrategy number two was going to be a little more difficult,\u201d she said, chuckling on the stand again.   Hope Hicks says she forwarded the Washington Post email seeking comment to several senior leaders of the campaign, including Jason Miller, David Bossie, Kellyanne Conway, and Steve Bannon.   Asked what her first reaction was to receiving the email from the Washington Post reporter, Hope Hicks says, \u201cI was concerned. Very concerned.\u201d   \u201cThere was a lot at play,\u201d she testifies.   \u201cI was concerned. I was concerned about the contents of the email. I was concerned about the lack of time to respond. I was concerned we had a transcript without a tape. There was a lot at play,\u201d she says.   Hicks is being shown a copy of the email she received from the Washington Post reporter who was seeking comment after the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.   The email has been accepted into evidence and is being shown to everyone now.   Hicks smiles as she recalls she forwarded the email to others on the campaign.   The subject line reads \u201cURGENT WashPost query.\u201d   \u201cI have an extremely urgent request for you today,\u201d the email from David Fahrenthold on October 7, 2016, reads.   The jury is also being shown the transcript on the monitors in front of them.   Hope Hicks, a former close aide to former President Donald Trump and perhaps the ultimate insider prior to the 2016 presidential election has been testifying for about a half-hour.   Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard so far from one of the trial\u2019s most-anticipated witnesses:   Working for Trump\u2019s campaign:   Familiarity with Trump\u2019s orbit:   Relationship with Trump:   Nervous on the stand:   Hope Hicks is testifying that she became aware of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape on October 7, 2016, after receiving an email from a Washington Post reporter seeking comment about it.   She said she was in her office on the 14th floor of Trump Tower at the time.   Hope Hicks testified that they were traveling every day for the campaign in the fall of 2016.   Hicks described her campaign travel in fall 2016, where they would go on Trump\u2019s plane from LaGuardia Airport and do between two and four stops per day. Most days, she says they would return to Trump Tower at the end of the day.   As Hicks testified, Trump wrote a note under the table and passed it to attorney Todd Blanche.   Hope Hicks was asked if she was ever in and out of the office when Donald Tump was meeting with David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, at Trump Tower.   \u201cI don\u2019t have a recollection of that,\u201d she testified.   Remember: Pecker testified that she was in and out of the August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower when the alleged conspiracy was hatched.   Hope Hicks says she was present for phone calls between David Pecker and Donald Trump during the campaign, including shortly after the National Enquirer published a piece on Ben Carson.   Trump \u201ccongratulated them on the great reporting,\u201d Hicks says. He called it \u201cPulitzer-worthy.\u201d   Hope Hicks described Trump and David Pecker as \u201cfriends.\u201d   She\u2019d been introduced to him in a previous job and reconnected with him later when she worked with Trump. \u201cI knew they were friends,\u201d she says.   Hicks doesn\u2019t recall when she knew that, but said \u201cat some point I realized that.\u201d   Prosecutors are asking Hope Hicks about David Pecker.   \u201cDo you know someone named David Pecker?\u201d prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asks.   \u201cI know him as the publisher of American Media,\u201d Hicks replies.   Hope Hicks continues to describe campaign operations.   \u201cMr.Trump was reachable. I mean, when he wasn\u2019t doing rallies and interviews, he had a phone and he could be reached. But Keith was also helpful in facilitating phone calls,\u201d Hicks said, referring to Keith Schiller.   Remember: Schiller served as the director of security for The Trump Organization and then as deputy assistant to President Trump and director of Oval Office operations.   In 2017, he\u00a0hand-delivered\u00a0a letter from the president firing FBI Director James Comey, entering the FBI headquarters with a manila folder and leaving without it.   Hope Hicks is potentially be a powerful witness for the prosecution because of her close ties to Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign.   \u201cUltimately, Hope Hicks was the ultimate insider,\u201d CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said. \u201cAnd prosecutors are focused on this crucial moment in time, right after the Access Hollywood tape dropped in October 2016.   \u201cI think they\u2019re going to elicit from Hope Hicks: \u2018What was happening inside the campaign? How concerned were you?\u2019\u201d     And unlike Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former fixer turned adversary, Hicks is someone who remains in Trump\u2019s good graces. (She is testifying due to a subpoena.)   \u201cIf and when she says something that\u2019s helpful for the prosecution\u2019s case, it\u2019s going to hit extra hard in favor of the prosecution because you can\u2019t say this is a person who has a gripe or a beef with Donald Trump,\u201d Honig added.   Hope Hicks confirmed during testimony that Trump was focused on press coverage of the campaign.   She checked with Trump before making statements to the press.   Hope Hicks says she traveled with Trump \u201calmost every day\u201d during the campaign.   Recalling who else would travel for the campaign with Trump, Hicks says \u201cthe core staff was very limited.\u201d   Donald Trump has turned his head at times toward Hope Hicks, including when she said he deserved credit for campaign messaging.   Hope Hicks says Trump was \u201cvery involved\u201d in his campaign and weighed in on media responses.   \u201cHe knew what he wanted to say and how he wanted to say it. We were all just following his lead,\u201d Hicks says.   \u201cHe deserves the credit for the different messages that the campaign focused on in terms of the agenda that he put forth,\u201d Hicks adds.   Hope Hicks is testifying about her role as campaign press secretary.   \u201cIt was kind of a constant flow of incoming questions so I managed all of those and tried to respond to everybody in a timely manner,\u201d she says.   \u201cIt was just me and Mr. Trump who is better than anybody at communications and branding,\u201d she says. There was no communications team at this point in the campaign.   Attorney Todd Blanche smiled at the compliment. Trump did not visibly react but he\u2019s studying the camera feed above him.   Hope Hicks recalled Donald Trump saying to her at one point that she\u2019d be the campaign press secretary, and she thought it was a joke because she had no experience.   She said that eventually she spent so much time working on the campaign it eventually ended up that way.   Trump and his attorney Todd Blanche appear to be watching Hope Hicks\u2019 testimony on a screen above them in the courtroom.   Trump and Blanche are whispering back and forth as Hicks testifies.   Hope Hicks is explaining how she began working for Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in 2015.   \u201cMr. Trump, one day said, \u2018We\u2019re going to Iowa,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t really know why,\u201d she says.     Attorney Todd Blanche smiled and leaned over to whisper in Trump\u2019s ear as she said this.   That initial Iowa trip was sometime in January 2015, she says.   Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo now asks Hope Hicks about Michael Cohen\u2019s role at The Trump Organization.   \u201cDo you know what kind of work he did?\u201d he asks.   \u201cNot specifically. I know he was involved in a couple of the licenses deals for some of the hotel projects and maybe some of the entertainment pieces as well, like Miss Universe pageant,\u201d she says.   Hope Hicks says that when she shifted to working on Trump\u2019s political campaign, Allen\u00a0Weisselberg helped with the personal financial disclosure Trump was required to provide.   He also provided an explanation they\u2019d share with the press about how Trump \u201cself-financed his campaign\u201d and \u201cloaned\u201d money to the campaign, she says.   Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asks Hicks to describe Weisselberg\u2019s relationship with Trump.   \u201cAlso mutual respect,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was a trusted person there.\u201d   \u201cAre you familiar with someone named Allen Weisselberg,\u201d prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.   \u201cYes,\u201d Hicks said.   Weisselberg was the former Trump Organization CFO.   Prosecutors are now asking about Rhona Graff, who was Trump\u2019s former longtime assistant. Graff testified last week.   Graff and Trump had a relationship of \u201cmutual respect,\u201d Hope Hicks testifies.   \u201cShe was crucial to how everything ran on the 26th floor, she had a lot of institutional knowledge,\u201d Hicks says.   When asked who Don Jr., Eric and Ivanka are, Hope Hicks gestures her hand toward the defense table, but keeps her gaze forward toward prosecutor Matthew Colangelo.   \u201cThey are Mr. Trump\u2019s children,\u201d she says.   Hope Hicks testifies that Donald Trump had a \u201cclose\u201d relationship with Keith Schiller.   Schiller served as the director of security for The Trump Organization and then as deputy assistant to President Trump and director of Oval Office operations.   In 2017, he hand-delivered a letter from the president firing FBI Director James Comey, entering the FBI headquarters with a manila folder and leaving without it.   Hope Hicks testifies that everybody who worked at the Trump Organization \u201cin some sense reports to Mr. Trump.\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s a very big and successful company but it\u2019s really run like a small family business in certain ways,\u201d Hicks says of Trump Org.   Hope Hicks says that by 2015, she spoke with Trump \u201con the phone every day if we weren\u2019t able to communicate in person.\u201d   \u201cI would usually call the office and be connected, but he had a cell phone or a home phone number as well,\u201d she says   Hope Hicks has avoided looking at Donald Trump in the courtroom as she answers questions from Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo.   It was not unusual for her to be in and out of Donald Trump\u2019s office during his meetings, Hope Hicks says.   Hope Hicks is describing working with Trump, saying, \u201che\u2019s a very good multitasker.\u201d   \u201cHe\u2019s a very hard worker. He\u2019s always doing many things at once,\u201d Hicks says of Trump.   Hope Hicks is saying that in 2014, she started as the director of communications for Trump Organization, working on public relations materials and marketing collateral for the real estate and hospitality businesses. She says those businesses \u201cwere thriving\u201d at the time.   Hicks says that when she transitioned into more of the political work, she began meeting with Trump more frequently.   Hope Hicks reiterated that she is nervous. She just stopped in the middle of her statement to say now that she can hear herself on the microphone, and it\u2019s going to take a moment to get used to.   Hope Hicks says she has no current professional relationship with Trump. He is not a client in her current role.   Hope Hicks said she was last in contact with Trump in the summer or fall of 2022.   Hope Hicks is testifying pursuant to a subpoena and is paying for her attorney.   Hope Hicks is describing her work with Ivanka Trump.   \u201cI was enjoying it so much that I was offered a position at the Trump Organization and jumped at the opportunity to join the company full time,\u201d she says.   Donald Trump is looking toward Hope Hicks as she begins speaking.   He\u2019s leaned back in his chair.   \u201cI\u2019m really nervous,\u201d Hope Hicks says while looking at the jury. She looks visibly uncomfortable after taking the stand.   Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo is handling the questioning.   Hope Hicks has entered the courtroom and is walking in the galley behind Trump.   Trump and attorney Todd Blanche smiled toward her.   She appeared to look straight ahead as she walked in.   Trump is speaking with his attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove while they wait for Hope Hicks to enter the courtroom.   Hope Hicks, once considered one of\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s closest confidantes, has been called to the stand as the prosecution\u2019s next witness.   As CNN has reported previously,\u00a0Hicks\u00a0appeared before the grand jury last year before Trump was indicted, as did Kellyanne Conway.   Hicks was Trump\u2019s press secretary during the campaign and could shed light on what was happening inside the political operation in the final weeks before the 2016 election, as\u00a0Michael Cohen was paying off\u00a0adult film star\u00a0Stormy Daniels to remain quiet about an alleged affair that Trump worried could upend his presidential campaign. Trump\u00a0reimbursed Cohen after he took office\u00a0and has since been charged with\u00a034 counts of falsifying business records.\u00a0The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair.   Federal search warrants released\u00a0in 2019\u00a0showed that prosecutors with the US attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York found\u00a0there was a mad scramble inside the Trump campaign\u00a0to suppress additional allegations of a sexual nature from becoming public after the\u00a0\u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d\u00a0tape was released in the fall of 2016.   At the time, Hicks called Cohen and Trump joined, according to the documents. From there Cohen, acting as a middleman, was involved in at least 10 telephone calls that day, some involving Trump and Hicks and others involving American Media Inc. executives David Pecker and Dylan Howard. AMI owns the National Enquirer tabloid.   Those conversations, FBI officials believed, were apparently about Daniels, an adult film actress also known as Stephanie Clifford, according to the documents.   When Hicks testified before the House Judiciary Committee\u00a0shortly before the documents\u2019 release,\u00a0she answered \u201cno\u201d when asked multiple times by Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee whether she was ever present when Trump and Cohen discussed Stormy Daniels, according to a transcript released of the closed-door interview.   Hicks also said she had no information about Daniels other than what she learned from reporters.   As prosecutors laid the foundation for their hush money criminal case against former President Donald Trump over the past several days, anticipation built for the appearance of a key witness: Hope Hicks, once considered one of\u00a0Trump\u2019s closest confidantes and most trusted aides.   Hicks was \u201cprivy to everything\u201d long before Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was taken seriously by many in the political establishment, says CNN national correspondent Kristen Holmes. \u201cShe is somebody who you would say, \u2018knows where the bodies are buried,\u2019\u201d Holmes said.   Hicks for many years served as the person who people would contact when they wanted to get access to Trump. That has given the potential of her testimony an air of deep intrigue.   Thursday, the prosecution entered a large batch of text messages into evidence, including messages between ex-Trump attorney Michael Cohen and\u00a0Hicks. The digital evidence also included Hicks\u2019 contact information on Cohen\u2019s phone.   Legal and political observers are watching closely for how she\u2019ll further factor into proceedings.   Georgia Longstreet says she looked at between 5,000 and 10,000 social media posts in connection to this case.   Attorney Todd Blanche asks Longstreet if she decided which posts would be shown in court today.   \u201cI\u2019m just a paralegal, I don\u2019t call the shots,\u201d she says.   He first clarified with her that prosecutors opted to introduce seven of the thousands of posts she reviewed.   Trump attorney Todd Blanche is asking Georgia Longstreet if she has listened to all of Michael Cohen\u2019s \u201cMea Culpa\u201d podcasts.   \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Longstreet says, generating laughs from the courtroom, including from Blanche.   Donald Trump leaned back and smiled.   Trump attorney Todd Blanche is starting questioning Georgia Longstreet, a paralegal at the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.   The jury was shown multiple social media posts from Donald Trump after prosecutors played the statement Trump released on Twitter in response to the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, including:   They also were shown Truth Social posts from last year:   Prosecutors are now playing the statement Trump released on Twitter in response to the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.   The statement said: \u201cAnyone who knows me knows these words don\u2019t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong and I apologize.\u201d   The video was played while embedded within the Trump tweet on the screen.   Donald Trump agreed to a stipulation indicating the Washington Post published an article on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape on October 7, 2016 at 4:01 p.m. ET.   \u201cJurors, the stipulation is information the parties have agreed to without the need to call a witness,\u201d Judge Juan Merchan explains, saying it should be considered as any other evidence.   The jury is back following this morning\u2019s break.   Defense attorney Todd Blanche objected to a Truth Social post where Donald Trump wrote, \u201cIf you go after me, I\u2019m coming after you.\u201d   Prosecutors want to get the post into evidence to show Trump\u2019s \u201cpressure campaign\u201d against witnesses set to testify.   Judge Juan Merchan said he is letting the social media post into evidence, saying he\u2019s satisfied that the prosecutors have laid proper foundation.   Judge Juan Merchan is going back through exhibits the defense is objecting to.   Attorney Todd Blanche says assuming the judge rejects his heresy objection they have agreed to a stipulation involving the Washington Post article. Prosecutors said with the stipulation, they will not seek to offer the Washington Post article.   Trump is looking at the screen as the judge is hearing arguments on the Twitter posts being admitted into evidence.   Judge Juan Merchan is back on the bench.   Georgia Longstreet, a paralegal in the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office, testified that she\u2019s reviewed anywhere between 5,000 and 10,000 social media posts related to the Trump case.   CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb in the courthouse said the witness is meant to establish a foundation so prosecutors can introduce social media posts made by Trump.   Longstreet is not a household name, but it\u2019s not uncommon to call a paralegal or other administrative staffer to testify.   \u201cTypically, you would call a paralegal \u2026 just to do basic mechanics,\u201d CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said. \u201c\u2018Yes, this is an article that appeared in the New York Post on such and such a date. This is a tweet or a Truth Social that was sent on such and such a date.\u2019\u201d   \u201cI have to wonder if they\u2019re being set up for, perhaps by the end of the day, we\u2019re gonna get a headline witness,\u201d such as Stormy Daniels, Honig suggested.     The jury has been excused, and court is taking a short break.   Georgia Longstreet is explaining to the jury that she placed the URL of websites into the Wayback Machine to retrieve news articles.   Prosecutors said earlier this morning they are using the digital archive service to introduce the Washington Post\u2019s article on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape as it appeared in October 2016.   Georgia Longstreet is now explaining the social media platforms Twitter and Truth Social.   Longstreet says she reviewed the account @realdonaldtrump on Twitter, and she confirms this was Donald Trump\u2019s account.   Prosecutors are expected to introduce social media posts made by Trump.   Trump\u2019s legal team signaled ahead of the hush money criminal trial that they would attack the veracity and completeness of the information on Michael Cohen\u2019s electronic devices \u2014 part of a broader strategy to chip away at the credibility of a key witness.   Before the trial began, Trump\u2019s team tried to subpoena the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s employee who was responsible for the phones during the four-day lapse before delivering the devices for review by the department of Douglas Daus, the man who we\u2019ve been hearing testify.   Trump\u2019s lawyers indicated in the letter they wanted to \u201cchallenge the integrity of evidence DANY will seek to offer from Cohen\u2019s phones, for use in cross-examination of Cohen\u201d and \u201cregarding the bias and hostility toward President Trump to attack the lack of integrity of DANY\u2019s investigation under federal constitutional.\u201d   Prosecutors have sought to push back on this angle from the defense in court today.   \u201cDid you see any evidence of tampering or manipulation on any of the data that you pulled related to the recording that\u2019s in evidence as people\u2019s 246?\u201d prosecutor Chris Conroy asked a short time ago.   \u201cI did not,\u201d Daus testified.   Remember: Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer and \u201cfixer,\u201d served federal prison time for actions he took while playing that role. Now he is a key prosecution witness who will testify later in the case.   Several witnesses have already testified to unsavory things about Cohen, and the defense has been highlighting his past wrongdoing in hopes of chipping away at his credibility before he takes the stand.   Georgia Longstreet says she identified \u201cpublicly available materials\u201d relevant to Donald Trump\u2019s case, including social media posts and news articles.   She says she\u2019s reviewed anywhere between 5,000 and 10,000 social media posts.   Trump is watching her and writing something. Meanwhile, attorney Todd Blanche is smiling.   The next witness is Georgia Longstreet, a paralegal at the district attorney\u2019s office.   Prosecutor Rebecca Mangold will question her.   Trump attorney Emil Bove smirked and shook his head as prosecutor Chris Conroy asked his last inquiry on another round of questions.   Donald Trump hit Bove\u2019s arm and gestured for him to get back up there, but Bove shook his head no.   Prosecutor Chris Conroy is back up for more questioning of witness Douglas Daus.   Conroy\u2019s one question was if he made a phone call seven years ago with the phone in his pocket he wouldn\u2019t expect to see it show up in the call log on the phone.   Daus responds, \u201cI would not.\u201d   Daus is off the stand.   The prosecution\u2019s redirect is over, and Trump attorney Emil Bove is back up for recross-examination.   Bove asks, \u201cDid you see gaps in the handling of this data that created risk for such tampering?\u201d   \u201cYes,\u201d Douglas Daus testifies.   Prosecutor Chris Conroy is asking Douglas Daus if he witnessed any evidence of tampering on data pulled from the recording on Michael Cohen\u2019s phone.   \u201cDid you see any evidence of tampering or manipulation on any of the data that you pulled related to the recording that\u2019s in evidence as People\u2019s 246?\u201d Conroy asks.   \u201cI did not,\u201d Daus testifies.   Prosecutor Chris Conroy is starting his redirect, and says digital evidence analyst Douglas Daus was asked a series of questions about a phone being used.   \u201cIt is unusual for a phone to be used?\u201d Conroy asks. \u201cNo,\u201d Daus says.   Conroy says that the other recordings Defense attorney Emil Bove asked about are not relevant to this case, which Daus confirms.   Trump wrote something on a notepad and handed it to Bove.   The defense has completed cross-examination of witness Douglas Daus and prosecutors are back for another round of questioning.   Earlier, Trump read a note from attorney Todd Blanche and leaned in to whisper to him as his attorney Emil Bove questioned the witness.   Trump attorney Emil Bove says Douglas Daus is looking at evidence from 2016 with all of these intervening events between the files and when he obtained Michael Cohen\u2019s phone in January 2023.   \u201cThey present questions about the reliability of the evidence,\u201d Bove says.\u201cIt would seem so,\u201d Daus testifies.   \u201cAll sorts of things have happened\u201d with Cohen\u2019s phone \u201cthat create variables that in your ideal situation would be investigated,\u201d Bove says. Daus agrees.   Criminal defense attorney Bill Brennan, who has represented Donald Trump in the past, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlin Collins that despite all the dramatic testimony so far, prosecutors have yet to tie wrongdoing to the former president.   \u201cWhat we\u2019ve heard so far is a lot of salacious conversations and sleazy deals between a disbarred lawyer who was known as the fixer, the [publisher] of a tabloid rag, and a lawyer that makes a living on the bottom selling non-disclosure agreements,\u201d Brennan said, referring to Michael Cohen, David Pecker and Keith Davidson, respectively.   \u201cThe jury\u2019s heard a lot of \u2018As the World Turns\u2019 soap opera testimony, but the prosecution has yet to tie it to this defendant,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to do that.\u201d     Trump attorney Emil Bove is now asking Douglas Daus about another sync of Michael Cohen\u2019s phone in October 2020.   \u201cWe don\u2019t know what it was from?\u201d Bove asks. \u201cI do not,\u201d Daus replies.   \u201cWe\u2019d have to take Michael Cohen\u2019s word\u201d for what happened to this phone in 2020, Bove says.   Douglas Daus explains that had the audio recording been edited or modified after September 6, it would show in the metadata.   Trump attorney Emil Bove moves to strike the answer \u2014 which Judge Juan Merchan overrules.   Bove then asks Daus if that was his hypothesis. Daus agrees, and confirms there was nothing in the metadata showing the file was modified.   Trump attorney Bove brings up that 46 seconds was cut off of the file of the September 6, 2016 audio recording on the phone between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump.   Daus agrees that he doesn\u2019t know how much longer the conversation between Trump and Cohen continued.   Bove continues by mentioning news coverage about the audio recording in 2018, asking Daus whether this means that Cohen and his attorney sent the file to the media in 2018.   \u201cCould have, yes,\u201d Daus says. He agrees that it shows \u201cthe file is out there\u201d in 2018.   Daus confirms that the data on the phone does not show a phone call that would have interfered with the recording on September 6.   Trump attorney Emil Bove asked Douglas Daus whether the reason that Trump\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen had so many contacts on his cell phone was because he synced the phone to his laptop, which was connected to his iCloud account.   Daus says it \u201ccould be\u201d an explanation for why Cohen had more than 39,000 contacts.   Trump attorney Emil Bove is asking Douglas Daus about a \u201cfactory wipe\u201d of Michael Cohen\u2019s first phone on October 1, 2016, after the date of the September 6, 2016 audio recording on the phone between Cohen and Donald Trump.   Bove asks Daus if the wipe \u201craises questions\u201d about that audio file.   \u201cYou have to have a look at where that file came from,\u201d Daus says.   Bove has Daus confirm that there was a backup and a sync of the phone in January 2017, when the phone was connected to Cohen\u2019s laptop.   Daus was asked if he knew what was transferred back to the phone.   \u201cThat file certainly,\u201d Daus said.   Douglas Daus confirms that Michael Cohen had encrypted messaging app Signal on his phone.   When users on Signal set up the app to delete messages, it is \u201cvery difficult\u201d to recover messages forensically, he explains.   Trump attorney Emil Bove is asking Douglas Daus about the chain of custody of Michael Cohen\u2019s two cell phones when they were turned over to the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office in January 2023.   There is a gap from January 19, when Cohen signed a form to turn over his cell phone, and January 23, when the cell phone was taken into custody, Daus agrees.   Douglas Daus, who processes digital evidence in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, is back on the stand to continue to be cross-examined by defense attorney Emil Bove.   Jurors are seated as the questioning is underway.   Remember: Prosecutors are presenting trial evidence through witness testimony and exhibits. Defense attorneys can cross-examine the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and typically aim to discredit their testimony.   Witnesses\u2019 responses are considered evidence, but not the questions posed by an attorney. Read up on the steps of the trial here.   Defense lawyers and prosecutors are in a bench conference before Douglas Daus is called back to the stand to continue his testimony.   While the lawyers sidebar, Trump is sitting with his eyes closed at the defense table.   Judge Juan Merchan reiterates that he ruled that a full transcript of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape can come into evidence per his previous ruling. But the judge says that the story in the Washington Post with a photo of Trump is \u201cdamning evidence\u201d and Merchan said he does not want those words associated with a photo of Trump for the jury.   \u201cIt\u2019s very powerful evidence, it\u2019s damning evidence, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Merchan says.   Merchan says that prosecutors need to have the ability to establish the date of the article, which is why they say they want to introduce it.   Donald Trump\u2019s attorney Todd Blanche is arguing that a Truth Social post from the former president from last August should also not come into evidence.   The post reads: \u201cIf you go after me, I\u2019m coming after you.\u201d   He said it\u2019s a reaction to calls by some political action committees to spend money to make sure Trump is not reelected. The campaign reacted forcefully, he said, and \u201cit had nothing to do with witnesses.\u201d   Trump attorney Todd Blanche invokes the recent Court of Appeals decision overturning Harvey Weinstein\u2019s conviction.   Judge Juan Merchan says \u201cthe Weinstein decision really doesn\u2019t factor into this.\u201d   The Weinstein reference came up as they were seeking to limit Access Hollywood tape references.   Trump attorney Todd Blanche is beginning by raising evidentiary objections to the next witness, a summary witness.   He cites a Trump post on Truth Social, Trump tweets and a tweet and article by the Washington Post and Blanche argues that there is hearsay information in the tweets and the article.   The article in question is the Post\u2019s piece on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape from October 2016.   \u201cThere\u2019s quotation marks around the entire article. The danger of unfair prejudice is extreme in this situation,\u201d Blanche argues.   Blanche is also arguing a tweet from the Washington Post should not come into evidence because it includes a photo of Trump, Billy Bush, and one of the women in the video.   Donald Trump appeared to look up at Judge Juan Merchan while the judge addressed him but gave no obvious acknowledgement or response.   Judge Juan Merchan is beginning court today by clarifying to Donald Trump that he has the \u201cabsolute\u201d right to testify if he chooses.   Merchan says he is doing this to clarify the gag order.   \u201cThe order restricting extrajudicial statements does not prevent you from testifying in any way,\u201d Merchan says. \u201cIt does not prohibit you from taking the stand and it does not limit or minimize what you can say.\u201d   The judge did not rule on the additional alleged gag order violations brought against Trump.   Judge Juan Merchan is on the bench and court is back in session.   \u201cGood morning, Mr Trump,\u201d Merchan said as proceedings picked up again.   Trump could be seen leaning forward to pose as photographers entered the room.   Prosecutors have entered the courtroom, as a digital evidence analyst in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is expected to return to the stand this morning.   We are expecting to hear more today from Douglas Daus, who works for the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. The prosecution called him to the witness stand on Thursday.   What Daus does: He processes digital evidence in the High Technology Analysis Unit.   \u201cIt\u2019s basically a way for the Manhattan DA\u2019s office to do their own analysis of electronic devices that are seized in investigations. And they have some really incredible people. As you can see from the cross-examination of this gentleman, he worked in Iraq and he\u2019s done intel work \u2014 I mean, just the most talented, incredible people work there and lend their expertise to the office to help them solve crimes,\u201d said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, the former chief assistant district attorney in the DA\u2019s office.   Prosecutors used Daus, who is their seventh witness, to introduce into evidence an audio recording of a crucial phone call from September 2016 between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump.   Jurors heard Cohen say on the call he needed to open a company, and that he\u2019s spoken with the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up. This company was to facilitate the $150,000 payment to Karen McDougal.   CNN reported in 2018 on a recording of the conversation.   Before court ended for the day, the defense was questioning Daus on whether he talked to anyone at the FBI about their extraction process on the phone before it was obtained by his office. There were earlier questions from defense about whether the integrity of data matters more in a criminal case because people\u2019s rights are at stake.\u00a0Defense also questioned whether it\u2019s ideal for a device that\u2019s obtained to go immediately \u201cin the vault.\u201d   CNN\u2019s Kristina Sgueglia contributed reporting to this post.   Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade has arrived at the Manhattan courthouse where the former president is expected to attend witness testimony from a\u00a0digital evidence analyst who so far helped introduce phone call recordings between former fixer Michael Cohen and Trump into evidence.   Court is at an abbreviated schedule, beginning at 9:30 a.m. ET and wrapping at 3:45 p.m. ET so a juror can make an appointment.   Donald Trump has been accused of taking part in an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election and an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, which included a hush money payment made to an adult film star to hide an affair.\u00a0The former president has denied the affair.   Prosecutors allege that Trump allegedly disguised the transaction as a legal payment and falsified business records numerous times to \u201cpromote his candidacy.\u201d Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records. He has pleaded not guilty.   Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade departed moments ago from Trump Tower and is heading to the Manhattan criminal court.   A Manhattan district attorney employee and digital evidence analyst, who helped introduce phone call recordings between former fixer Michael Cohen and Trump into evidence, is expected to return to the stand for defense cross-examination.   CNN\u2019s Kristina Sgueglia contributed reporting in this post.   Judge Juan\u00a0Merchan\u00a0held another gag order hearing Thursday morning to consider the prosecution\u2019s\u00a0four additional allegations\u00a0against former President Donald Trump in\u00a0the hush money trial.   Prosecutors are asking for a $1,000 maximum fine for each alleged violation, but they told Merchan they are not seeking to put Trump in jail. Trump earlier this week was fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order.   The judge did not immediately issue a ruling Thursday. Here\u2019s what to know:   Prosecutors allege several gag order violations:   \u2022\u00a0Trump is impacting the fairness of the trial:\u00a0\u201cHis statements are corrosive to this proceeding and the fair administration of justice,\u201d prosecutor Chris Conroy said. \u201cThe defendant is doing everything he can to make this case\u201d about politics.   \u2022\u00a0Trump is aware of gag order parameters:\u00a0Conroy reminded the court that Trump attorney Todd Blanche assured the judge last week that\u00a0the former president \u201cdoes, in fact, know what the gag order\u00a0allows him to do and not allow him to do.\u201d   \u2022\u00a0No jail request: Prosecutors told the judge they were not seeking that Trump be incarcerated for the violations.   Trump\u2019s defense argues he did not violate gag order:   \u2022\u00a0Trump needs to defend himself against attacks:\u00a0Blanche argued that upcoming witnesses Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels are \u201cnot people who need to be protected.\u201d   \u2022\u00a0\u201cDaring\u201d Trump to reply:\u00a0\u201cCohen has been inviting and almost daring President Trump to respond to almost everything he\u2019s saying,\u201d Blanche said. He added that Daniels shouldn\u2019t be covered by the gag order either, though he acknowledged that her comments about Trump are not so \u201cvoluminous.\u201d Merchan reiterated that the order means Trump is \u201cnot allowed to refer\u201d to foreseeable witnesses.   Read more about the gag order and yesterday\u2019s hearing.   Former President Donald Trump is on trial in Manhattan for his alleged role in a\u00a0hush money scheme\u00a0to silence his alleged mistresses before the 2016 election.\u00a0He faces 34 counts related to \u201cfalsifying New York business records in order to conceal damaging information and unlawful activity from American voters before and after the 2016 election.\u201d   Prosecutors need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\u00a0Trump falsified business records with the intent to commit or conceal another crime, but they don\u2019t have to prove that Trump committed that crime. The prosecution theory is that the second crime could be in violation of federal and state election laws or state tax laws regarding how the reimbursements to Michael Cohen were handled.   Trump\u2019s attorneys have kept their defense close to the vest, but in court filings they\u2019ve indicated that they plan to attack the credibility of Cohen and Stormy Daniels and paint them as liars who are motivated by grudges and money.   Trump\u2019s legal team is led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, two former federal prosecutors from New York, and Susan Necheles, a veteran criminal defense lawyer with deep experience in New York and before Merchan. Necheles represented Trump\u2019s business at its\u00a0tax fraud trial in 2022. The company was convicted.   Outside lawyers who have been following the case closely say Trump is likely to argue that hush money payments are legal and distance the former president from the repayment scheme and bookkeeping handled by his trusted employees. They may also argue the payments were made to prevent embarrassment to Trump\u2019s family and not to influence the election.\u00a0Trump could also testify in his own defense. He has testified in two recent civil trials, after regretting not taking the stand in a prior civil trial, but the stakes are higher in a criminal case.   Former President Donald Trump has been accused of taking part in an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election and an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, which included a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to hide an affair.\u00a0Trump has denied the affair.   Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, received a $130,000 payment just days before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors allege Trump disguised the transaction as a legal payment and falsified business records numerous times to \u201cpromote his candidacy.\u201d Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records. He has pleaded not guilty.   Daniels\u00a0shared in a documentary\u00a0released in March that she accepted the payment to keep her one-night stand with Trump in 2006 from becoming public to protect her husband and daughter.   Meanwhile, Karen McDougal is a model and actress who has said she had a monthslong affair with Trump in 2006. She was paid $150,000 to keep quiet about it by the National Enquirer, according to prosecutors. Trump has denied the affair.   While the hush money trial is focused on the hush money deal involving Daniels, prosecutors have used the alleged McDougal payoff as evidence the schemes were aimed at protecting Trump\u2019s electoral chances.   See a full timeline of key moments in the case.   Former President Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial\u00a0is expected to take six to eight weeks  from start to finish.   Where we are in the trial: Prosecutors are presenting trial evidence through witness testimony and exhibits. Defense attorneys can cross-examine the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and typically aim to discredit their testimony.   The defense is expected to continue to cross-examine the prosecution\u2019s seventh witness today, digital evidence analyst Douglas Daus. Witnesses\u2019 responses are considered evidence, but not the questions posed by an attorney.   To better understand what\u2019s going on as the proceedings progress, CNN compiled the steps of a criminal trial. Read up on the stages of the proceedings here.   We\u2019re now in the third week of court proceedings in Donald Trump\u2019s historic hush money criminal trial.   To refresh your memory, here are the key moments and witnesses from the trial so far:   April 15: Trial began with jury selection   April 19: A panel of 12 jurors and six alternates was selected.   April 22: The prosecution and defense made their opening statements. Former tabloid boss David Pecker was called to testify.   April 23: Judge Juan Merchan held a Sandoval hearing for Trump\u2019s alleged gag order violations, but reserved his decision.   April 25: While Trump sat in the Manhattan courtroom, the Supreme Court heard arguments on the matter of his immunity in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion case against him.   April 26: Pecker\u2019s direct questioning and cross-examination concluded. Trump\u2019s former longtime assistant Rhona Graff was called to testify briefly. Finally, Michael Cohen\u2019s former banker Gary Farro testified.   April 30: Farro\u2019s testimony concluded. Prosecutors then called Dr. Robert Browning, the executive director of C-SPAN archives, and Philip Thompson who works for a court reporting company.\u00a0Then, Keith Davidson, the former attorney for Daniels and McDougal, took the stand.   May 2: Davidson\u2019s testimony concluded. Digital evidence analyst Douglas Daus was called to testify.   Here are the top takeaways from Thursday, which was Day 10 of Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial:   Trump lawyer drags Davidson through the celebrity mud: After prosecutors finished walking Keith Davidson meticulously through the deals he cut before the 2016 election for both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, Trump\u2019s attorney dragged Davidson through the proverbial celebrity mud, ticking through a host of deals he was involved with related to other high-profile figures.   Emil Bove pressed Davidson on whether he had studied extortion law when he sought money from AMI and Michael Cohen for the McDougal and Daniels deals. Bove asked Davidson whether he went \u201cright up to the line without committing extortion\u201d with the Trump deals. Without saying so specifically, the upshot from Trump\u2019s attorney was that the Trump deals followed a pattern that bordered on extortion. The upshot from Trump\u2019s attorney was that the Trump deals followed a pattern that bordered on extortion.   Another gag order hearing over Trump comments: Merchan held a second hearing Thursday morning over more gag order violations prosecutors want Trump held in contempt for. Merchan did not rule on the latest allegations after Thursday\u2019s hearing. Prosecutor Chris Conroy pointed to four of Trump\u2019s comments since last Monday \u2014 two were about Cohen, the others were about the jury and former AMI chief David Pecker. The district attorney\u2019s office wants Trump fined $1,000 for each violation but is not yet asking Merchan to jail him, noting the inconvenient slowing effect it\u2019d have on the trial.   Witnesses don\u2019t have nice things to say about Michael Cohen: Davidson was just the latest witness to testify to unsavory things about Cohen \u2013 Trump\u2019s former fixer and a key prosecution witness who will testify later in the case. Davidson described how Cohen was difficult to deal with, frequently acting in a \u201cpants on fire\u201d manner. Davidson testified that he had \u201clost trust\u201d with Cohen to pay the money he\u2019d agreed to in the\u00a0Daniels deal \u2013 and at one point he said the deal was off after Cohen failed to meet a deadline.   Keith Davidson, a key witness who negotiated the\u00a0Stormy Daniels\u00a0and Karen McDougal hush money agreements, was back on the stand on Thursday in the criminal trial against Donald Trump.   The lawyer helped negotiate the deals to silence Daniels and McDougal over their alleged encounters with Trump. Davidson\u00a0said in an interview with CNN in 2018\u00a0that he\u2019d spoken with Michael Cohen on several occasions about the two women.   On cross-examination, the defense painted Davidson as a shady lawyer who goes \u201cright up to the line without committing extortion\u201d on multiple cases involving not only Trump but other celebrities.   The next witness was Douglas Daus, who works for the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office in the High Technology Analysis Unit. He is expected to continue his testimony today.   Here\u2019s what happened in court Thursday:   Prosecution:   Defense cross-examination:   Douglas Daus   Gag order hearing: Judge Juan\u00a0Merchan\u00a0held a gag order hearing Thursday morning to consider the prosecution\u2019s four additional allegations against Trump. Earlier in the week, the judge levied\u00a0a $9,000 fine against Trump\u00a0for multiple violations of the judge\u2019s gag order barring public discussion of witnesses in the case or the jury.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol.   Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private.   According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case.   In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms.   \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024.   In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol.   \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot.   There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees.   \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.   CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021.   Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024.   One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden.   CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d   \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN.   \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued.   The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen.   Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d   Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes.   \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020.   Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results.   \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell.   In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC.

Byron Donalds, a Donald Trump loyalist and one of the former president\u2019s most trusted surrogates, is widely viewed to be on Trump\u2019s short list of vice presidential contenders.   But in 2011, Donalds posted to Facebook celebrating Trump\u2019s decision not to challenge then-President Barack Obama for the White House.\u202f\u201cTrump won\u2019t run. Thank God!\u201d Donalds wrote in one Facebook post in May 2011.   CNN\u2019s KFile unearthed numerous examples of Donalds directly criticizing Trump in social media posts and interviews in 2011 and 2012, when he was an outspoken tea party activist running \u2013 unsuccessfully, then \u2013 for a seat in Congress. He attacked Trump\u2019s protectionist stances on trade and called out Trump for his birtherism comments about Obama.   \u201cTrump is a huge distraction, and cares more about himself than the country in my opinion, but I could care less about him,\u201d Donalds wrote in a Facebook post in April 2011 when discussing Trump\u2019s claims that Obama\u2019s birth certificate was fake.   \u201cI don\u2019t question his religion or his citizenship,\u201d Donalds said. \u201cQuite a few Democrats and liberals still think Bush caused 9/11.\u201d   \u201cTrump is a self-promoter yelling about 25% tariffs on China,\u201d Donalds said in the same string of Facebook posts.   In other public comments from the same time, Donalds argued against Trump\u2019s calls to boost US manufacturing, saying it was cheaper to make clothes in China than in Michigan, and said he favored privatizing entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which would be better as a \u201cvoucher,\u201d along with raising the retirement age.   A spokesman for Donalds defended him in a comment to CNN.   \u201cPresident Trump is considering Byron as his running mate because of the Congressman\u2019s steadfast support for the 45th President and his historic policy agenda. The fact that these decade-old posts are now resurfacing in the middle of running mate deliberations is weak but typical of CNN.\u201d   Donalds is far from the only Republican vice-presidential contender to have criticized Trump in the past. Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance called Trump a \u201cmoral disaster\u201d in direct messages from the summer of 2017 that were made public in 2021. And New York Rep. Elise Stefanik criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric in 2015, 2016 and 2017 for \u201ctapping into the fear of our security situation\u201d and his \u201cinsulting\u201d comments about women and disparaging remarks on Muslims.   Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has been floated as possible VP pick, harshly criticized Trump on a number of occasions when the two faced off for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.   But the Trump campaign views Donalds as among its most effective surrogates for the former president, one that could help him peel Black male voters from President Joe Biden.   Donalds rose to prominence in Trump world last year when the Florida congressman endorsed Trump over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who he had appeared closely aligned with. The decision stunned and unnerved the DeSantis team, but propelled Donalds to Trump\u2019s inner circle, where he remains.   Related article DeSantis and his team unleash on Rep. Donalds for questioning Florida\u2019s new Black history standards   Trump routinely praises Donalds during campaign rallies and has publicly thanked him for his support. He\u2019s a frequent commentator on conservative media, with a 2023 analysis from the left-leaning Media Matters finding he appeared on Fox News weekday programs 193 times between August 2017 and October 2023.   While Trump has asked allies their thoughts on Donalds as vice president, advisers have acknowledged the complications of this scenario given they both are residents of Florida.   The 12th Amendment doesn\u2019t forbid a president and vice president from the same state, but it requires electors to vote for at least one candidate from a different state than theirs, meaning either Trump or Donalds would need to change their state residency in order to collect electoral votes from Florida. If Donalds changed his residency, he would need to resign from Congress.   Donalds\u2019 past comments demonstrate just how much Trump has transformed the GOP. A decade ago, Donalds was espousing the virtues of free trade and the need to shrink the size of the federal government through cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Yet he now supports Trump\u2019s calls for tariffs on imports and the need to protect entitlement programs.   Donalds lost his 2012 race for Congress, failing to win the Republican nomination in a crowded primary field that year.\u00a0 But he would get elected in 2016 to the Florida House of Representatives. During his primary for the statehouse, he defended Trump as \u201cauthentic\u201d and spoke at a rally for him in September 2016.   By the time Donalds was elected to Congress in 2020, he had fully embraced the Trump agenda, aligning himself closely with the then-president\u2019s policies and rhetoric and solidifying his position as a staunch Trump supporter within the party.   When Donalds was first elected to Congress his website\u2019s homepage featured a picture of him embracing then-President Trump.   \u201cHe\u2019s everything the fake news media says doesn\u2019t exist: a Trump supporting, liberty loving, pro-life, pro-2nd Amendment black man,\u201d Donalds\u2019  website read.   But Donalds\u2019 embrace of Trump when running for Congress was a far cry from his tea party activism a decade ago.   Guest-hosting a radio show in 2012, Donalds defended Mitt Romney, then the Republican nominee for president by arguing in support of outsourcing after a co-host said Romney lacked \u201ccorporate patriotism.\u201d   \u201cCorporate patriotism, what are you talking about corporate patriotism,\u201d Donalds said, when a host said Romney moved jobs overseas.   \u201cIf that shirt is manufactured in, let\u2019s say Michigan, that shirt will probably cost you $50,\u201d Donalds said as a guest. \u201cHow does that help middle income families who can\u2019t afford a $50 shirt but can afford a $30 shirt from Bangladesh or China or Taiwan wherever it\u2019s made.\u201d   \u201cFree trade raises the standard of living every time it is done,\u201d Donalds added.   The comments on trade aren\u2019t the only tea party-era policy issues that would set him at odds with Trump. During his 2012 campaign for Congress, Donalds heavily embraced calls to privatize Social Security and Medicare \u2013 two programs Trump (and Donalds) now promise not to cut.   And the videos of local campaign stops and musings on social media from his time as a tea party activist could prove a liability for Donalds in the jostling to be vice president occurring behind the scenes.   \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to call it a voucher because that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s gonna be: A voucher,\u201d Donalds said at one local Republican event in April 2012\u00a0 when campaigning for Congress.   Democrats argued in 2012 that budget plans supported by Rep. Paul Ryan, Romney\u2019s vice presidential running mate, would turn Medicare into a \u201cvoucher\u201d system, which Republicans typically called \u201cpremium support,\u201d instead. Under the proposals, the government would subsidize seniors by partially paying for private plans or a traditional Medicare plan.   Unlike most Republicans, Donalds embraced the term.   \u201cI think we need to go to a private account system similar to what they did in the country of Chile,\u201d he added on Social Security in an appearance on a radio show in June 2012.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Michele Morrow, a conservative activist who last week upset the incumbent Superintendent of Public Instruction in North Carolina\u2019s Republican primary, expressed support in 2020 for the televised execution of former President Barack Obama and suggested killing then-President-elect Joe Biden.   In other comments on social media between 2019 and 2021 reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile, Morrow made disturbing suggestions about executing prominent Democrats for treason, including Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Hillary Clinton, Sen. Chuck Schumer and other prominent people such as Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates.   \u201cI prefer a Pay Per View of him in front of the firing squad,\u201d she wrote in a tweet from May 2020, responding to a user sharing a conspiracy theory who suggested sending Obama to prison at Guantanamo Bay. \u201cI do not want to waste another dime on supporting his life. We could make some money back from televising his death.\u201d   In another post in May 2020, she responded to a fake Time Magazine cover that featured art of Obama in an electric chair asking if he should be executed.   \u201cDeath to ALL traitors!!\u201d Morrow responded.   In yet another comment, Morrow suggested in December 2020 killing Biden, who at that time was president-elect, and has said he would ask Americans to wear a mask for 100 days.   \u201cNever. We need to follow the Constitution\u2019s advice and KILL all TRAITORS!!! #JusticeforAmerica,\u201d she wrote.   CNN reached out to Morrow and her campaign multiple times but did not receive a response. Following publication of this story, Morrow\u00a0defended her previous tweets, claiming Obama committed treason.   Last Tuesday, Morrow defeated Catherine Truitt, the incumbent North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction, in the Republican primary. Morrow, a registered nurse and grassroots activist who homeschooled her children, ran on a platform of supporting parental rights and opposing critical race theory.   As superintendent, Morrow would oversee the state\u2019s public school system and help set educational priorities, manage the school system\u2019s budgets, and work with the state\u2019s Board of Education to set and implement curriculum standards. Her website lists endorsements by \u201cconservative school boards\u201d but remains light on changes she\u2019d make if elected.   Morrow has in the past called public schools \u201csocialism centers\u201d and \u201cindoctrination centers.\u201d   In a campaign speech in February, Morrow advocated for a constitutional amendment to abolish the state Board of Education, which sets policies and procedures for public schools in the state. Doing away with the board would put direct\u00a0control over the state\u2019s education agenda under the superintendent and the state legislature, which is currently controlled by Republicans.   \u201cI\u2019d like to see a constitutional amendment to get rid of the state Board of Education,\u201dshe said.\u00a0\u201cIf the superintendent is elected and works under the legislature - knowing that they\u2019re accountable to the legislature to oversee the DPI and to oversee and have impact into the superintendents in the 115 districts, I think we would be so much better off because you don\u2019t have all these extra people right in mix.\u201d   Morrow has espoused a wide range of extreme views on social media in recent years. Many of her past extreme comments were made on her now-dormant personal Twitter account \u2014 which is separate from her campaign account.   Morrow also promoted QAnon slogans and tweeted that the actor Jim Carrey was \u201c\u2026 likely searching for adrenochrome\u201d \u2013 a reference to a conspiracy theory shared by QAnon believers that celebrities harvest and drink the blood of children to prolong their own lives. Media Matters, a left-leaning publication, was first to report the QAnon tweets.   All together, Morrow tweeted \u201cWWG1WGA\u201d \u2013 the slogan that stands for \u201cwhere we go one, we go all\u201d and is commonly associated with the QAnon conspiracy \u2013 more than seven times in 2020.   Central to QAnon lore is the notion of the \u201cStorm,\u201d a belief there will be a day when thousands will purportedly be arrested, subjected to military tribunals, and face mass executions for their alleged crimes, with Donald Trump leading efforts to dismantle them alongside other QAnon \u201cpatriots.\u201d   Morrow\u2019s post about publicly executing Obama was just one of numerous she has made espousing carrying out violent fantasies against Democrats.   On Twitter, the platform now known as X, and on the now-defunct conservative Twitter alternative, Parler, Morrow used the hashtag \u201c#DeathtoTraitors\u201d a combined 12 times \u2013 usually in relation to prominent Democrats.   \u201cObama did it. Hillary did it. Schiff did it. Comey did it. Yates did it. Holder did it. Clapper did it. Gates did it. Fauci did it.

Ilhan Omar and other Democrats, suggesting their impending death for unspecified \u201ctreason.\u201d   \u201c@IlhanMN and her other law-hating Dems must be getting a little nervous. Are they just realizing the punishment for treason is death?!?\u201d Morrow wrote.   In a post on Parler, Morrow used the hashtag #deathtotraitors in discussing the Democratic governors of North Carolina and New York, Cooper and Cuomo. Morrow publicized her Parler handle in a tweet and CNN found the deleted Parler posts on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine.   \u201cOur Communist sympathizer, Comrade Cooper, has the same plans for NC!Expose them NOW!Can we we see the CCP list, @SecPompeo??? #PrisonTimeforFederalCrimes #DeathToTraitors #FreeOurCitizens,\u201d Morrow wrote in 2020, discussing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.   In other posts on Parler, Morrow shared posts from other users and a QAnon account about locking up Democrats at Guantanamo Bay and prisons.   Morrow\u2019s ire also went beyond Democrats, including one post in December 2020 calling for putting Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia in prison after he certified Georgia\u2019s results for Joe Biden in that year\u2019s presidential election.   In other comments, Morrow repeatedly shared the false claim that Obama was Muslim, called Islam evil, and expressed belief in a conspiracy theory that tens of thousands of Chinese troops were stationed in Canada to invade the United States to help Joe Biden become president.   \u201cTens of thousands of Chinese soldiers are already in Canada and probably Mexico waiting for orders to invade,\u201d she wrote on January 8, 2021.   In another post from September 2019, Morrow said that Barack Obama (referred to as B.O.) was a puppet for the \u201cDeep State\u201d and the \u201cMuslim movement\u201d and suggested he pay the highest penalty for his alleged crimes.   \u201cB.O. was a puppet for the Deep State and the Muslim movement to destroy our Constitutional Republic.

Chesebro denied using Twitter, now known as the platform X, or having any \u201calternate IDs\u201d when directly asked by Michigan investigators last year during his\u00a0cooperation session, according to recordings of his interview obtained by CNN.   But CNN linked Chesebro to the secret account based on numerous matching details \u2014 including biographical information regarding his work, family, travels and investments. The anonymous account, BadgerPundit, also showed a keen interest in the\u00a0Electoral College process\u00a0and lined up with Chesebro\u2019s private activities at the time.   The Twitter posts reveal that even before the 2020 election, and then just two days after polls closed, Chesebro promoted a far more aggressive election subversion strategy than he later let on in his Michigan interview.  Chesebro\u2019s social media presence Pro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro told Michigan investigators that he doesn\u2019t have any social media accounts, including Twitter. But CNN uncovered a secret Twitter account that Chesebro used to anonymously post about the 2020 election in real-time. Source: Obtained by CNN  Chesebro\u2019s lawyers confirmed to CNN that the BadgerPundit account belonged to Chesebro, describing it as his \u201crandom stream of consciousness\u201d where he was \u201cspitballing\u201d theories about the election \u2013 but insisted that it was separate from his legal work for Trump\u2019s campaign.   \u201cWhen he was doing volunteer work for the campaign, he was very specific and hunkered-down into being the lawyer that he is, and gave specific kinds of legal advice based on things that he thought were legitimate legal challenges, versus BadgerPundit, who is this other guy over there, just being a goof,\u201d said Robert Langford, an attorney for Chesebro.   Chesebro has not been charged with any crimes in Michigan and sat for an hourslong interview with the state attorney general\u2019s office in early December. In his retelling to Michigan prosecutors, Chesebro has cast himself as a moderate middleman who was duped by Trump\u2019s more radical lawyers.   Asked about the secret tweets, Danny Wimmer, a spokesman for Michigan Attorney General\u00a0Dana Nessel, said in a statement to CNN, \u201cOur team is interested in the material and will be looking into this matter.\u201d   Chesebro claimed to investigators he saw the\u00a0alternate slates of Republican electors\u00a0only as a contingency plan to have ready in case the Trump campaign won any of its more than 60 lawsuits challenging the election results \u2014 which it didn\u2019t. He also told Michigan investigators that in his conversations with the Trump campaign, he made clear that \u201cstate legislatures have no power to override the courts.\u201d   But just days after the 2020 election, BadgerPundit tweeted that the court battles didn\u2019t matter and that Republican-controlled legislatures should send in their own GOP electors, predicting even then that then-Vice President Mike Pence could use them to throw the election to Trump.   \u201cYou don\u2019t get the big picture. Trump doesn\u2019t have to get courts to declare him the winner of the vote. He just needs to convince Republican legislatures that the election was systematically rigged, but it\u2019s impossible to run it again, so they should appoint electors instead,\u201d wrote BadgerPundit on\u00a0November 7, 2020,\u00a0the day multiple media outlets, including CNN, called the election for Joe Biden.   Yet in his interview with Michigan investigators, Chesebro said the very opposite, claiming that the entire electors plan was contingent on the courts.   \u201cI saw no scenario where Pence could count any vote for any state because there hadn\u2019t been a court or a legislature in any state backing any of the alternate electors,\u201d Chesebro said.  Purpose of the fake electors Pro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro told Michigan investigators that he told the Trump 2020 campaign that the \u201calternate electors\u201d should only be used in conjunction with ongoing litigation. But CNN found tweets from 2020 where Chesebro dismissed the role of the courts and said the electors alone could overturn the election. Source: Obtained by CNN  After the 2020 election, BadgerPundit tweeted more than 50 times that Pence had the power to count the electors benefitting Trump, according to a CNN KFile analysis of the account.   Chesebro also told investigators that he felt \u201cmisled\u201d by the Trump campaign for concealing the entirety of their plan from him. He claimed that it wasn\u2019t until last year that he fully realized the campaign had always intended to deploy the fake electors regardless of the outcome of its election lawsuits.   That idea was first raised in a September 2020 article in\u00a0The Atlantic, which quoted a \u201cTrump legal adviser\u201d who described using alternate electors to overturn a Trump loss.   When asked by Michigan investigators if he had knowledge of The Atlantic article at the time it was published, Chesebro said he did not. Yet BadgerPundit\u00a0tweeted\u00a0about it the same day it was published and defended the plot.   Chesebro\u2019s attorneys acknowledged in an interview with CNN that \u201cthere\u2019s clearly a conflict\u201d between some of his tweets and what he told Michigan prosecutors, and that some of the elector theories he embraced online were \u201cinconsistent\u201d with his subsequent legal advice to the Trump campaign.   Some of Chesebro\u2019s anonymous tweets were previously reported by\u00a0Talking Points Memo.\u00a0The BadgerPundit account went private sometime in late 2022, but CNN was able to access the since-removed public tweets by using the Wayback Machine, an internet archive.   The\u00a0fake electors plot\u00a0features prominently in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s federal election subversion indictment against Trump, who has pleaded not guilty. Chesebro has been identified by CNN as an\u00a0unindicted co-conspirator\u00a0in that case.   Chesebro was indicted alongside Trump in a separate 2020 election interference case in Georgia. He\u00a0struck a plea deal\u00a0there in October, agreeing to plead guilty to one felony count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. He\u00a0gave proffer interviews\u00a0to Georgia prosecutors as part of the cooperation agreement, though it\u2019s unclear if he was asked about his social media accounts.   Michigan investigators secured Chesebro\u2019s cooperation in December, after previously\u00a0charging the 16 fake electors\u00a0in that state with multiple felonies. Chesebro has additionally met with investigators in Wisconsin and Arizona who are probing their fake electors, and he\u00a0avoided charges in Nevada\u00a0after cooperating with prosecutors there.   If Chesebro intentionally misled investigators, he could face legal jeopardy.   \u201cChesebro appears to have pursued a legally perilous path in his dealings with Michigan authorities,\u201d said Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University, who reviewed the posts for CNN. \u201cThe Twitter posts strongly suggest Chesebro committed the crime of making false statements to investigators\u2026 his entire cooperation agreement may now fall apart.\u201d   It appears Chesebro \u201chid highly important evidence in the form of these social media posts from the investigators,\u201d Goodman said, adding that it could put Chesebro \u201cat great legal risk.\u201d   \u201cWe should have asked for clarity, and that was our screw-up,\u201d Chesebro attorney Manny Arora told CNN about Chesebro denying to Michigan prosecutors that he used Twitter. Arora said he has since provided \u201call the information on BadgerPundit\u201d to investigations in \u201call the different states that are involved,\u201d where Chesebro sat for interviews.   CNN has not reviewed the agreement between Chesebro and the Michigan Attorney General\u2019s office. Wimmer, a spokesman for the office, confirmed that it was a \u201cproffer agreement,\u201d where a witness can provide information with some protection from prosecution. Wimmer declined to describe the details of the agreement.   The same prosecutors signed a more sweeping cooperation deal with one of the 16 fake electors where they\u00a0dropped his charges\u00a0in exchange for his testimony and future cooperation. That deal required the fake elector to \u201cprovide full and complete information\u201d and turn over \u201cany and all relevant documents.\u201d If the cooperator \u201cgives false, incomplete, misleading testimony or information,\u201d the deal would be voided and they\u2019d be \u201csubject to full prosecution, including perjury and obstruction of justice.\u201d   CNN was able to verify Chesebro\u2019s connection to the BadgerPundit account by reviewing emails between Chesebro and the Trump campaign that reference the account, as well as by matching numerous biographical details between the two.   In an email to Trump attorneys in early December 2020, Chesebro linked\u00a0to a Google Drive account\u00a0for the email address TheBadger14@Gmail.com, which was once used by BadgerPundit in a tweet\u00a0as his contact information. Chesebro also cited the BadgerPundit account in emails to a Trump campaign official and attorney John Eastman on January 5, 2021, pointing to tweets from BadgerPundit arguing that Pence had the authority to pick the electors on January 6.   Related article Exclusive: Pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro cooperating in multiple state probes\u00a0into 2020 fake electors plot   Other biographical details related to his personal life also matched Chesebro, including his current marriage, his past legal work on Bush v. Gore, investments in cryptocurrency, past references to high school and growing up in Wisconsin \u2013 the Badger state.   BadgerPundit,\u00a0like\u00a0Chesebro,\u00a0said he was with\u00a0right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on January 6, 2021. The account also\u00a0references staying\u00a0at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, from January 3 through the 8 \u2013 the\u00a0same dates\u00a0Chesebro told Trump lawyers he was staying at the hotel in emails obtained by the January 6 committee.   In his interview with Michigan investigators, Chesebro repeatedly tried to downplay his knowledge of the electors plan. He told investigators that he did not know that the Trump campaign planned to deploy \u201calternate electors\u201d in contested states when he first spoke with the campaign in mid-November 2020.   \u201cI naively assumed that it hadn\u2019t occurred to them to have alternate electors. That is, I only thought of it because I\u2019d been involved in Bush v. Gore in 2000 and I\u2019d worked on a law review article with Professor [Laurence] Tribe in 2001 about Bush v. Gore,\u201d Chesebro said. \u201cSo, I thought I was educating them about this.\u201d   He continued to tell investigators that the plan went beyond what he advised them to do.   \u201cThe idea of alternate electors wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d come up with and then the Trump campaign learned about it and then backed off. My understanding is that they planned to do this all along,\u201d Chesebro said.  Story in The Atlantic Pro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro told Michigan investigators that, long after the 2020 election, he realized the full scope of the Trump campaign\u2019s fake electors plot when he belatedly read a September 2020 article from The Atlantic that foreshadowed the upcoming scheme. But CNN found a tweet from the day the article was published of Chesebro opining about the article and endorsing the \u201calternate\u201d electors plan. Source: Obtained by CNN   Source: Obtained by CNN  Chesebro denied to investigators that at the time he was aware of The Atlantic article from September 23, 2020 detailing how a more radical fake electors plan might work, and he reiterated that he always viewed fake electors as a way to buy more time for lawsuits, and as a contingency to be used only if the Trump campaign had pending litigation in the seven contested states.   But privately, as BadgerPundit on Twitter, Chesebro was familiar with the fake electors plot as early as September 2020, and defended the Trump campaign\u2019s ability to pursue the plan just days after the election.   As BadgerPundit, Chesebro rebutted a Twitter user who said The Atlantic article foreshadowed the \u201cdeath of democracy.\u201d Chesebro replied, \u201cit\u2019s called politics, dude,\u201d and argued that state legislatures get the \u201cultimate call\u201d on who wins and loses presidential elections.   Chesebro told investigators that only later did he realize that the Trump campaign had plans to pursue a more radical version of the fake electors scheme no matter what \u2014 something that he told investigators he did not advise at the time.   \u201cAnd so my point is, it seems if you credit The Atlantic article, they wanted to do unconditional alternate electors, lobby the state legislatures, and then pressure Pence to back that,\u201d said Chesebro.   \u201cI just feel like I was misled into pushing alternate electors for a reason to win more time, to win litigation when there was, there was certainly more to the agenda. I mean, maybe not every person that was in touch with me had this plan, but the campaign as a whole had a different plan than [what] they revealed to me,\u201d said Chesebro.   \u201cI certainly would not have said what I said to the electors and advise them on what the campaign wanted if I\u2019d known the campaign had a broader agenda than they told me,\u201d said Chesebro.   In his interview with Michigan investigators, Chesebro said that after the 2020 election, he repeatedly advocated for a more conservative approach to the fake electors plot.   \u201cUltimately where I came down was I wanted conditional language in all the states that I suggested three times to Trump campaign on December 12th, that they make it conditional on winning litigation. Number two, I made clear in November 23rd that the state legislatures have no power to, to override the courts. And number three, I made clear in December 13th that I didn\u2019t think Pence should be involved at all,\u201d Chesebro told investigators, adding, \u201cI was never on board with what apparently they planned to do from the beginning, and which they never told me they planned to do.\u201d   Less than two days after polls closed on the 2020 presidential election, Chesebro, as BadgerPundit, began publicly tweeting the framework for the \u201calternate elector\u201d strategy that the Trump campaign ended up pursuing.   That included embracing the end-around plan of using state legislatures to overturn the results \u2013 which he later claimed to oppose in his interviews with Michigan prosecutors. He\u00a0tweeted: \u201cthe election can\u2019t be rerun. This [sic] only solution is for the Legislature to intervene and select the electors.\u201d   In another tweet from\u00a0November 5, 2020, BadgerPundit outlined a potential plan for Trump.   \u201cHe will push it all the way to early January, and if necessary, rely on Pence to count only electoral votes sent in by the Republican legislatures, or count no disputed electoral votes, and throw the election to the House, which will elect Trump. 80/20 in Trump\u2019s favor,\u201d he wrote.   In a series of tweets, BadgerPundit suggested he knew the plan was extremely controversial and suggested how to make the plot more palatable after a user wrote that no state \u201cwill want to be first.\u201d   \u201cThe key to the politics\u201d of the plan would rest on state legislatures not invalidating the results of election day but rather \u201cexpressing their own preference\u2026 of electors to be sorted out in January,\u201d Chesebro wrote.   Speaking to Michigan investigators, Chesebro criticized the more radical plan put forth by conservative attorney\u00a0John Eastman, which included having state legislatures choosing their own slates of electors for Pence to count on January 6.   \u201cSo, Eastman, he had this idea the state legislatures could somehow be effective in overturning the courts, which I thought was ridiculous,\u201d Chesebro told investigators.   But under his online alter ego, BadgerPundit, after the election he tweeted numerous times that Pence had the power to count the fake electors benefitting Trump.   \u201cI think Pence, in counting electoral votes, could decide that the electoral votes of the legislature take priority,\u201d the pseudonymous Twitter account\u00a0wrote\u00a0on November 7, 2020, hours after the election was called for Biden by multiple media outlets.   Though Chesebro\u2019s lawyers told CNN that BadgerPundit and the Trump campaign \u201cnever intersected,\u201d emails obtained by CNN reveal that he sent two emails to the campaign citing a\u00a0BadgerPundit thread\u00a0arguing that Pence had the power to count disputed electoral votes. Chesebro sent the thread to Eastman and Trump lawyer Boris Epshteyn, but he did not tell them it was his account, the emails show.  Pence\u2019s role on January 6 Pro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro told Michigan investigators that he didn\u2019t think then-Vice President Mike Pence should interfere with Congress\u2019 counting of the electoral votes on January 6, 2021. But CNN found tweets from 2020 where Chesebro advocated for Pence to play an active role on January 6 and recognize the \u201calternate\u201d GOP electors from states Donald Trump had lost. Source: Obtained by CNN  On November 9, 2020, BadgerPundit wrote, \u201cI predict that on December 14, in several states both the Trump and Biden electors will cast their votes, and the electoral votes of any State still in dispute on January 6 won\u2019t be counted. If neither candidate has 270 votes, the House will then vote Trump a second term.\u201d   A few days later, on November 11, 2020, BadgerPundit repeatedly tweeted that the fake electors could cast their votes for Trump and that Republican legislatures would certify only those votes.   \u201cIt\u2019s obvious Trump will win. You overlook the power of the Republican legislatures to certify that Trump is the winner, thus leading the Senate not to find that Biden attained 270 electoral votes. Then, game over,\u201d\u00a0he wrote.   BadgerPundit\u00a0wrote on December 28, 2020,\u00a0\u201cMy understanding is that they\u2019re the votes of the Trump-Pence electors who were actually on the ballot in the contested States. So if whoever counts electoral votes thinks they won \u2026 well, they won.\u201d   Chesebro traveled to Washington in early January 2021, he told investigators, to be available for strategy meetings. He was\u00a0seen outside the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, following Alex Jones.   Even after the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, Chesebro continued to insist that Pence had the power to count electors to benefit Trump but \u201cpretended his hands were tied.\u201d   BadgerPundit\u00a0tweeted on January 7, 2021, \u201cBut \u2026 There was a non-frivolous argument that the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional, and the VP has the power to count, as Jefferson did. Pence could have set up a test case, yet he pretended his hands were tied. And, Trump really believes he won!\u201d   CNN\u2019s Selwyn Rocha contributed to this report.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

He\u2019s called Trump a \u201cfake Republican\u201d who stokes \u201chatred and fear\u201d and suggested that the former president\u2019s popularity is the result of \u201cignorance in our society.\u201d   In several previously unreported audio clips and deleted tweets, uncovered by a CNN KFile review of Moreno\u2019s past statements, the Ohio Republican harshly criticized Trump.   But Moreno has since come to praise Trump and earned the former president\u2019s endorsement as he tries for a second time to win the Republican nomination for the Senate, this time in an effort to oust Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown.   Moreno now attacks the \u201cwine-sipping country club Republicans\u201d who are \u201coffended by President Trump\u2019s words.\u201d He characterizes individuals imprisoned for Capitol riot-related offenses as \u201cpolitical prisoners,\u201d claims that the 2020 election was stolen, and alleges collaboration between \u201cbig tech,\u201d \u201cthe swamp,\u201d the corporate media, and Democrats to rig the election.   Despite this, he previously congratulated President Joe Biden on his 2020 presidential win and after the attack on the Capitol in January 2021, Moreno posted \u201c[Trump] deserves lots and lots of blame for this,\u201d adding, \u201cHe didn\u2019t calm tensions; no one (and certainly not me) has excuses [sic] that behavior.\u201d   Moreno\u2019s about-face is stark, but also reflects a broader trend among Republicans across the country, many of whom have been critical of Trump in the past only to later embrace him.   That includes Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who Trump endorsed instead of Moreno in 2022\u2019s Senate primary. Vance once said publicly he did not vote for Trump in 2016 and suggested in private messages that year that the former president might be \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler.\u201d He later called him a \u201cmoral disaster\u201d in 2017.\u202f\u202fWhile running for Senate that year, Vance said he regretted his past comments criticizing Trump and has since come to loudly praise the former president.   As Trump closes in on securing the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, allegiance to Trump and his agenda have once again become a litmus test for party loyalty.\u00a0Both Moreno\u2019s Republican opponents, state Sen. Matt Dolan and Ohio\u2019s Secretary of State Frank LaRose have themselves a history of past Trump criticism. While Dolan has stood by much of his criticism, LaRose has made public gestures to appeal to Trump, including seeking his endorsement and firing a staffer critical of the former president.   A Colombian-born, American-raised car dealership owner and wealthy businessman, Moreno was a prolific Republican donor for years before first running for Senate in 2022.   In October 2016, Moreno posted on Twitter in a reply that he wrote-in a vote for Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u2013 a tweet his campaign spokesman Conor McGuinness tells CNN was meant in \u201cjest,\u201d and that Moreno \u201cabsolutely voted for Trump in 2016.\u201d   Appearing on a now-defunct radio show earlier that year he said,\u202f\u201cThere\u2019s no scenario in which I would support Trump,\u201d adding Trump played to people\u2019s \u201cworst emotions.\u201d \u201cIf Trump is the nominee, I think the Republican party is now a different party and not a party that I want to be a part of.\u201d   Moreno was withering in since-deleted tweets from 2016, calling Trump a \u201cfake Republican,\u201d and saying he was \u201cconspiring\u201d with his \u201cally\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to take down the Republican Party. He mocked Trump\u2019s signature red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and disparaged Trump in messages to mainstream media reporters.   \u201cWhat Trump\u2019s message is really about, is that the America that we really want?\u201d Moreno added on the radio show. \u201c\u2026where hatred is stoked and fears are what drive our decision making?\u201d   During a local forum on race relations in February 2016, Moreno criticized the rise of populism in the election cycle, subtly alluding to candidates such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, and implied that their support stemmed from a deficiency in education.   \u201cWe\u2019re living in an interesting year of populism on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Moreno said at the forum, comparing it to politics in South America. \u201cAnd the best defense against that populism is education. Really being aware, because people do take advantage of ignorance in our society all the time.\u201d   Moreno\u2019s spokesman told CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Bernie, like many others, was initially skeptical of President Trump, but he has never been so happy to be proven wrong about something.\u201d   \u201cBy the time the 2020 election came around, he was an avid supporter and is proud to have been the first candidate for US Senate to endorse President Trump in the 2024 race,\u201d the spokesman said.   In an interview with local news in Cleveland in April 2019, Moreno disputed that he supported the Trump campaign when asked.   \u201cMy daughter works on the Trump campaign,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I support the Trump campaign. Different story. You can interview my daughter if you like.\u201d   In response to a request by CNN for evidence of his support for Trump in 2020, Moreno\u2019s campaign provided a picture of the back of a man\u2019s head they purported to show Moreno attending a speech in October 2020 by then-Trump campaign surrogate Richard Grenell at a Trump Victory Committee event in Cleveland.   Right after the 2020 election, Moreno repeatedly criticized election deniers, urged Republicans to accept the results and even debunked fraud allegations. But these days, Moreno says the 2020 election was stolen \u2013 a conversion that appears tied to his Senate campaigns.   In December 2021, Moreno\u2019s campaign released an ad in which Moreno embraced election denialism.   \u201cPresident Trump says the election was stolen, and he\u2019s right,\u201d Moreno said directly looking into the camera.   In early February 2022, Moreno dropped out of the Senate race at Trump\u2019s urging; Trump eventually endorsed Vance for the Senate seat.\u202fIn this race, Moreno has continued to embrace false election claims.   \u201cAnybody who had eyes and ears knows what happened in 2020,\u201d Moreno said at an October forum.   Moreno deleted tweets he posted before the 2020 presidential election urging Americans to \u201caccept the results,\u201d and deleted tweets praising mail-in voting \u2013 which Trump has falsely claimed is rife with fraud. Moreno removed a post saying he would accept the results himself.   In one removed tweet from November 29, 2020, more than three weeks after the election, Moreno attacked Trump directly.   \u201cFor\u202f@realDonaldTrump\u202f to make claims of a fraudulent election without proof. Potentially irreparable harm to US,\u201d he said.   Also among Moreno\u2019s deleted posts is a November 7, 2020 tweet, where he acknowledged Biden\u2019s win and called for unity. He purged tweets where he urged conservatives to accept the outcome and debunked fraud allegations by highlighting Republican gains in the House. He also said that he himself voted by mail in 2020, calling it \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cconvenient.\u201d   As rioters poured into the Capitol on January 6, 2021 and in its aftermath \u2013 Moreno again broke with Trump. He praised Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a prominent Trump supporter in the Senate, who declared \u201ccount me out\u201d in an impassioned speech on the Senate floor the night of the riot.   \u201cLindsay [sic] brought the heat! Nicely said,\u201d wrote Moreno.   In another since-removed tweet from January 7, 2021, Moreno wrote that the rioters \u201cmade a \u201cquite a horrific embarrassment for our country.\u201d   McGuinness, Moreno\u2019s spokesman, said he did not see contradiction in Moreno\u2019s past comments.   \u201cBernie has also been tremendously clear that January 6th has exposed a two-tiered justice system in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who burned down buildings in June of 2020 faced minimal retribution; grandmothers who walked down the wrong hallway on January 6th are still sitting in federal prison. That is appalling.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans \u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network.", "Donald Trump defends former influencer convicted of election interference who has racist, antisemitic past | CNN Politics": " Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have come to the defense of a one time social media influencer who has been convicted of election interference and has a well-known history of pushing deeply racist, antisemitic, anti-Muslim and homophobic content online.   In a video posted by his campaign in early December, former President Trump blasted President Joe Biden and \u201chis henchmen\u201d for allegedly trampling on the First Amendment rights of Douglass Mackey, a longtime supporter of the former president who ran an anonymous, notorious Twitter account in 2016. Trump accused Biden of seeking to jail Mackey for \u201csharing a joking meme about Hillary Clinton several years ago. Nobody ever heard of anything like that.\u201d   While the former president criticized the legal action taken against Mackey, Trump Jr. lauded the content featured on Mackey\u2019s Twitter feed. He praised Mackey on his December 7 podcast as \u201cmaybe my favorite Twitter account of all time\u201d and said the Biden administration wanted the former influencer in prison.   Mackey, however, was under federal investigation for conspiracy to suppress votes in the 2016 presidential election during Trump\u2019s administration. Mackey was charged seven days after Biden took office and convicted earlier this year. He was sentenced to seven months in prison but is currently out pending an appeal of his case.   Prosecutors said Mackey, 34, targeted Black voters on Twitter with a tweet meant to look like a campaign advertisement that falsely claimed they could vote for Clinton through text messages during the 2016 election.   Mackey\u2019s Twitter account at the time featured a slew of hateful content and he was ranked as 107th in a list of \u201celection influencers\u201d in the runup to the 2016 election, according to an analysis conducted by the MIT Media Lab.   In a statement to CNN, an attorney for Mackey said the tweets don\u2019t reflect his client\u2019s current views, and that Mackey now regrets the tone and substance of his posts.   \u201cHowever, he does not regret using his anonymous account to promote conservative political ideas or then-candidate Donald Trump,\u201d attorney James Lawrence said in the statement. \u201cDoug is grateful that former President Trump, his son, and thousands across the political spectrum can see through these smears and distractions and recognize that his case is about protecting the First Amendment rights of all Americans.\u201d   On Twitter, Mackey had regularly shared racist caricatures of people of color, amplified demeaning stereotypes and belittled entire groups with racial slurs. He used the N-word in multiple posts, and he described Black people as \u201cferal.\u201d Antisemitism was another popular theme for him, and he routinely shared memes reminiscent of Nazi propaganda.   One post, for example, included a comment about decorating a cake with a Jewish slur, a reference to putting Jews in gas chambers and praise for Hitler. In another post, he hinted at retribution for Jewish Americans if Trump won presidency in 2016.   \u201cThe jews fear that Donald Trump is Hitler because they know that they have done great evil in America. They fear justice will be done,\u201d he wrote in December 2015.   CNN reviewed Mackey\u2019s tweets on the Internet Archive Way Back Machine and Archive Today, but is sharing only a small subset of them due to their nature.   Mackey used the pseudonym \u201cRicky Vaughn\u201d on Twitter, but his identity was publicly exposed in a 2018 Huffington Post article. His vitriolic posts ended after that.   During his trial, Mackey testified he had apologized to his family over his tweets and that he had started therapy which he said changed his life.   \u201cIt was in bad taste,\u201d Mackey said of his social media conduct. \u201cIt was wrong. It was offensive.\u201d   Though contrite in court, Mackey struck a different tone in media interviews, oscillating between defiant and unapologetic over his case, while asking for financial support for his appeal. A defense fund set up to aid his appeal \u2014 and promoted by Mackey \u2014 prominently displays the avatar of his old Ricky Vaughn account.   In an interview with Tucker Carlson last month, Mackey described the content of his Twitter account as \u201cpro-Trump, memes, jokes, all kinds of links, that kind of thing.\u201d   Since his conviction, and subsequent appeal, Mackey has become a cause celebre among some conservatives, who say the government is attempting to suppress free speech from Trump supporters.   Among those who have expressed support for Mackey are right-wing pundit Carlson and presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. A spokesperson for Ramaswamy said the candidate was unaware of the racist content in Mackey\u2019s other posts.   One of the more vocal Mackey supporters has been Trump Jr.   On his Rumble show earlier this month, the former president\u2019s son praised Mackey\u2019s online activity, calling him \u201cthe original badass account\u201d and \u201cone of the funniest accounts out there\u201d on Twitter during what he labeled \u201cthe meme wars\u201d in 2016.   \u201cHow many of you guys in the live chat remember the Ricky Vaughn account?\u201d Trump Jr. asked his audience. \u201cBecause it was epic, man. It was, it was really good.\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s great to have you, you know, we\u2019ve probably gone back and forth on Twitter back in the old days in DMs,\u201d he added when Mackey appeared on his show.   \u201cIt may be my favorite Twitter account of all time,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll get in trouble for saying that cause they\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, he said something once that you must disavow,\u2019 \u2014 it was hilarious. Like again, like I said, maybe the best of all time\u201d   Jared Holt, an expert on extremism at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said Mackey\u2019s popularity online was largely attributable to his peddling of hateful content.   \u201cMackey deliberately escorted unfettered White supremacy and antisemitism into the online space surrounding the Trump 2016 campaign,\u201d Holt told CNN.   First Amendment experts were mixed on the strength of the government\u2019s case against Mackey with some saying the case could be overturned on appeal.   \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it went either way,\u201d said Aaron Terr of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a group focused on freedom of speech. \u201cThe First Amendment doesn\u2019t allow the government to have a general power to police alleged misinformation because there\u2019s a very high risk that the government would abuse that power in political and partisan ways.\u201d   \u201cOne of the purposes of the First Amendment,\u201d he added, \u201cis to provide ample breathing space for public debate.\u201d   Prosecutors, however, said Mackey\u2019s fake vote-by-text ad had significant consequences. At least 4,900 individuals texted the deceptive text code circulated by Mackey, though CNN can not confirm how many of those who texted didn\u2019t vote.   \u201cIt\u2019s one thing if somebody tells a joke or forwards a single meme, but when you, as the jury found, are engaged in a serious effort to trick people out of having their vote count, or otherwise, to take illegitimately, take votes away from a candidate, that\u2019s against the law,\u201d Norm Eisen, a senior CNN legal commentator, said.   Holt said he found it troubling that Trump and his supporters are seeking to recast Mackey as\u202fsome sort of First Amendment hero.   \u201cThat Trump and his allies have turned Mackey into a martyr is disgraceful, and the complete indifference his supporters have shown to championing a hate-monger is concerning,\u201d Holt said. \u201cThe ease at which Mackey has been falsely portrayed as a simple, well-meaning man makes me worry that there is no sort of gatekeeping or self-enforcement happening in the Trump movement anymore.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN fact-checked 12 of the former president\u2019s October and November speeches. We found, as we did during his 2016 campaign and his presidency, that Trump\u2019s fall remarks were\u00a0teeming with false claims \u2013 a staggering quantity and variety of misrepresentations, exaggerations and outright lies that made sheer wrongness a central feature of each of his addresses.   As in the past, Trump is in a league of his own. The frequency of his mendacity vastly exceeds that of either President Joe Biden or any of Trump\u2019s rivals in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.   In the October and November speeches, Trump was serially untruthful on the subject of his record in office. He continued to tell long-debunked lies about the 2020 election he lost and the integrity of elections more broadly. He repeatedly fabricated and embellished on the subjects of energy, the environment, foreign affairs and the economy.   He launched incorrect attacks against Biden, other Democrats and Republican presidential rivals Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley. He deployed various fictions to support his denunciations of the criminal and civil court cases against him. And he continued his traditional practice of wildly exaggerating statistics, this time on topics ranging from the price of bacon to the cost of an aircraft carrier to the size of his rally crowds.   Below is a fact check of 102 of Trump\u2019s false claims from the 12 speeches. He repeated many of the false claims on multiple occasions.   This is not intended as a comprehensive list. And it does not include gaffes that were clearly unintentional, claims that were misleading but not outright wrong, or claims for which there was no public evidence but which we could not definitively declare incorrect.   Terrorist attacks under Trump   Trump claimed in numerous speeches that there were no terrorist attacks during his time as president. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an attack for four years,\u201d he said in an October speech in New Hampshire while touting his ban on travel from a group of (mostly Muslim-majority) countries he described as \u201chorrendous, dangerous nations.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t have one incident in four years, because we kept bad people the hell out of our country,\u201d he said in an October speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition.   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cwe didn\u2019t have an attack for four years\u201d isn\u2019t true.   Trump\u2019s own Justice Department alleged that a mass murder in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was a terrorist attack carried out in support of ISIS; Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. Trump\u2019s Justice Department also alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia\u2019s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, \u201cwas motivated by jihadist ideology\u201d and was carried out by a longtime \u201cassociate\u201d of al Qaeda.   In addition, there were a variety of other terrorist attacks during Trump\u2019s presidency. Notably, Trump\u2019s Justice Department said it was a \u201cdomestic terrorist attack\u201d when one of Trump\u2019s supporters mailed improvised explosive devices to CNN, prominent Democratic officials and other people in 2018.   In 2019, a White supremacist pleaded guilty to multiple charges in New York, including first-degree murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism, for killing a Black man in March 2017 to try to start a race war. And Trump\u2019s Justice Department described a 2019 shooting massacre at a Walmart in Texas as an act of domestic terrorism; the gunman who killed 23 people was targeting Latinos.   Trump\u2019s wall promise   In an October speech in Iowa, Trump claimed he had run in 2016 on a promise that Mexico would pay for \u201ca piece\u201d of a new border wall. He repeated the claim in a November speech in Florida, saying, \u201cI said Mexico\u2019s gonna pay for a piece of the wall.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims about what he said in the past are false. During his 2016 campaign, Trump promised over and over again in his public remarks, with no qualifications, that Mexico would pay for the entire wall, not for only \u201ca piece\u201d of it. (In the end, Mexico didn\u2019t pay for any of it.) You can read a longer fact check on this claim here.   Mexico and the cost of the wall   In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump tried to respond to critics who have noted that he did not get Mexico to pay for the wall as he had promised. Pointing out that Mexico did deploy thousands of its own troops during his presidency to deter migrants heading toward the US, Trump said, \u201cThen they say, \u2018Oh, Mexico didn\u2019t pay.\u2019 Mexico paid a fortune for that wall. When they tell you, \u2018Trump didn\u2019t get the money.\u2019 Remember, I used to say Mexico will pay for it. Well, that\u2019s what I did.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims that he \u201cdid\u201d get Mexico to pay for the wall and that \u201cMexico paid a fortune for that wall\u201d are false. Mexico deploying troops simply isn\u2019t the same as Mexico paying for a construction project; even with the Mexican deployment, the US had to pay for the wall with its own money. The Trump administration directed more than $16 billion toward the project \u2013 including about $6 billion directly appropriated by Congress and about $10 billion the administration repurposed from the Defense Department \u2013 before Biden halted construction upon taking office in 2021.   The final bill for the project is unclear; more than $4.7 billion of the former Defense Department money had not been spent at the time Trump left office. Regardless, it is clear that Mexico spent nothing at all on the project.   \u201cThe US government paid for what was built of Trump\u2019s wall out of our own treasury. Mexico did not directly pay for any portion of the wall,\u201d Theresa Cardinal Brown, an immigration and border policy expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, said in a July email.   The size of the wall   Touting his wall on the border with Mexico, Trump claimed in speech after speech that he had built \u201c561 miles of wall\u201d or, more vaguely, that the total was \u201cover 500 miles.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s \u201c561 miles\u201d and \u201cover 500 miles\u201d claims are false, both exaggerations. An official report by US Customs and Border Protection, written two days after Trump left office and subsequently obtained by CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez, said the total number built under Trump was 458 miles (including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers). Even in his recent speeches, Trump sometimes put the figure, more correctly, at \u201cnearly 500 miles.\u201d   For example, in one October speech in Iowa, Trump said, \u201cWe built 561 \u2013 they said 460, 460. But no, it\u2019s 561.\u201d Later in the speech, though, when he appeared to be reading from his prepared text, he said, \u201cBuilt nearly 500 miles.\u201d   Trump and the military   In speech after speech, Trump repeated a claim he had made during his presidency \u2013 saying \u201cI fully rebuilt the US military,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve rebuilt the entire military,\u201d or \u201cwe rebuilt our whole military.\u201d He periodically made clear that he was talking about military equipment, saying that, before he came along and did this rebuilding, the country had \u201c48-year-old fighter jets.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim to have rebuilt the entire military is false. \u201cThis claim is not even close to being true. The military has tens of thousands of pieces of equipment, and the vast majority of it predates the Trump administration,\u201d said Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.   Harrison said in a November email: \u201cMoreover, the process of acquiring new equipment for the military is slow and takes many years. It\u2019s not remotely possible to replace even half of the military\u2019s inventory of equipment in one presidential term. I just ran the numbers for military aircraft, and about 88% of the aircraft in the U.S. military inventory today (including Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps aircraft) were built before Trump took office. In terms of fighters in particular, we still have F-16s and F-15s in the Air Force that are over 40 years old.\u201d   Trump\u2019s policy on damage to monuments   In an October speech in New Hampshire and a November speech in Florida, Trump claimed that, as president, he had found and \u201csigned\u201d an \u201cold law\u201d or \u201cold statute\u201d to impose a severe penalty \u2013 an automatic 10 years in jail \u2013 for people who damage monuments.   \u201cIt said if you so much as touch one of our statues or memorials, you go to jail for 10 years with no probation, no anything \u2013 you go for 10 years. And you all remember that,\u201d he said in the Florida speech.   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are false. He didn\u2019t sign any \u201claw\u201d on damage to monuments, and he did not impose automatic 10-year sentences for monument damage. In fact, he issued an executive order on the subject, in 2020, that did not mandate any increase in sentences.   Rather, the executive order simply directed the attorney general to \u201cprioritize\u201d investigations and prosecutions of monument-destruction cases and declared that it is federal policy to prosecute such cases to the fullest extent permitted under existing law \u2013 including an existing law that allowed a sentence of up to 10 years in prison for willfully damaging federal property if the damage exceeds $100. The executive order did nothing to force judges to impose a 10-year sentence.   Trump and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve   As he has on multiple previous occasions, Trump claimed in an October speech in New Hampshire that \u201cwe filled up the national reserve, strategic reserves.\u201d He went into more detail in a November speech in Houston, saying of the reserve, \u201cWe filled that thing and nobody ever saw anything like it.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims that he filled the Strategic Petroleum Reserve are false.While he did propose to buy 77 million barrels for the reserve in 2020 as oil prices cratered because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Democratic-controlled Congress rejected the $3 billion in funding that would have paid for the purchase, describing it as a subsidy to big oil companies, so it didn\u2019t happen. The reserve contained fewer barrels when Trump left office in early 2021 (about 638 million) than when he took office in early 2017 (about 695 million).   That\u2019s in large part because of oil sales that Congress had mandated by law. But nonetheless, Trump\u2019s claims about how he \u201cfilled up\u201d the reserve are meritless.   \u201cIt would have been a smart policy to refill the SPR at very low prices, but it didn\u2019t happen because Congress did not approve that purchase. I suppose Trump can take credit for a good idea, but not for execution,\u201d Ben Cahill, a senior fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told CNN earlier this year when Trump made a similar claim.   Trump and manufacturing jobs, part 1   Trump claimed in a November speech in Texas: \u201cWe created an incredible 1.2 million new manufacturing jobs. Nobody said that was possible.\u201d He repeated the number a bit later and said, \u201cEverybody said that was impossible.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s number is false. The US actually lost 170,000 manufacturing jobs during Trump\u2019s presidency, largely because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even if you were to stop the count in February 2020, before the pandemic crash, the US would have gained 419,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency in January 2017, not the 1.2 million he claimed here.   In speeches in late 2019 and early 2020, Trump claimed that the US had created 1.2 million manufacturing and construction jobs during his tenure. That would still be true today if you stopped the clock in February 2020. But Trump didn\u2019t mention construction jobs in this speech; his omission made his performance with manufacturing jobs sound much better than it was.   Trump and manufacturing jobs, part 2   Trump vowed in the same speech in Texas to \u201caccelerate our manufacturing resurgence,\u201d then said, \u201cWe were setting records \u2013 not only were we building and doing it, we were setting records at doing manufacturing jobs.\u201d   \ufeffFacts First: This is false. Trump did not come close to setting records for the creation of manufacturing jobs. Again, US manufacturing employment actually declined by 170,000 jobs during his presidency. While that\u2019s largely because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the US was not even setting records before that; the country lost manufacturing jobs in 2019, before the pandemic hit.   And while the US did see a 430,000-job gain in manufacturing employment under Trump in 2017 and 2018, that was nowhere near a record increase. For example, there were more than 1.5 million manufacturing jobs added in 1977 and 1978, Jimmy Carter\u2019s first two calendar years as president.   Household income under Trump   Trump claimed in an October speech in New Hampshire: \u201cUnder President Trump, real family income increased over $6,000 a year.\u201d\u00a0 He had made a similar claim in a speech in Iowa that month, saying real family income \u201cwent up by more than $6,000 a year.\u201d   Facts First: This is false. Real median household income actually increased by $5,820 in total over Trump\u2019s four years in office, from $70,840 in 2016 to $76,660 in 2020 \u2013 so not $6,000 \u201ca year\u201d as he claimed here.   Trump\u2019s campaign has previously confirmed he was referring to real median household income when making such claims. The increase in real median household is over $6,000 if you just look at the period from 2016 to 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, but Trump\u2019s presidency includes 2020 as well.   Trump and the defeat of ISIS   As he has in the past, Trump claimed in an October speech in New Hampshire: \u201cI defeated ISIS. I defeated ISIS. Three weeks, I defeated ISIS.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim of having defeated ISIS in \u201cthree weeks\u201d isn\u2019t true; the ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump\u2019s presidency, in 2019. Even if Trump was starting the clock at the time of his visit to Iraq in late December 2018, as he has sometimes suggested, the liberation was proclaimed more than two and a half months later. In addition, Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has before, when he said \u201cI defeated ISIS\u201d with no caveats or credit to anyone else: Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting, and there was major progress against the caliphate under President Barack Obama in 2015 and 2016.   IHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. \u201cThe Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group\u2019s governance project,\u201d an analyst there said in a statement at the time.   The cost of an embassy move   In October speeches to the Republican Jewish Coalition and at a campaign event in Florida, Trump repeated a story he used to tell during his presidency about how moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was supposed to cost $1 billion or $2 billion but that he \u201cgot it done for $500,000\u201d by using an existing US diplomatic facility in Jerusalem.   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. While the final cost of the embassy move isn\u2019t publicly known, it is clear that the cost was much more than $500,000. The State Department awarded a $21.2 million contract in 2018 for a company to design and build \u201ccompound security upgrades\u201d related to Trump\u2019s decision to turn the existing Jerusalem facility into an embassy. The initial modification that allowed the building to open as an embassy cost just under $400,000, but that was not the final total.   Trump and the construction of Nord Stream 2   Trump claimed in an October speech in New Hampshire that, after he \u201cstopped\u201d Russia\u2019s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline to Germany, \u201cit was totally dead\u201d before Biden allowed it to proceed.   Facts First: Trump did not render Nord Stream 2 \u201ctotally dead.\u201d While he did approve sanctions on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already around an estimated 90% complete \u2013 and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project said shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company announced in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump\u2019s term in January 2021, Germany announced that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters.   The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up halting the project as Russia was about to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The pipeline was damaged later that year in what has been described as a likely act of sabotage.   Trump and awareness of Nord Stream 2   In a November speech in Houston, Trump said of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline: \u201cNobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2 until I came along. Nobody knew they were building the biggest pipeline anyone\u2019s ever seen, I guess \u2013 covering all of Europe.\u201d   Facts First: Both parts of this claim are wrong.   It\u2019s not true that \u201cnobody\u201d had heard of Nord Stream 2 before Trump began discussing it. Nord Stream 2 was a regular subject of media, government and diplomatic discussion before Trump took office. In fact, Biden publicly criticized it as vice president in 2016. And Nord Stream 2 was nowhere close to \u201cthe biggest pipeline anyone\u2019s ever seen.\u201d   Trump and deportations to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador   In a November speech in Florida, Trump talked about how his administration was able to deport gang members to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador \u2013 and repeated his familiar false claim about how the Obama administration was supposedly unable to do so: \u201cUnder the Obama administration, they wouldn\u2019t take anybody back. They put airplanes, big commercial planes on the runways, so we\u2019d put them in a plane, we\u2019d fly, we couldn\u2019t land, came back. And this went on for years; never took \u2018em back.\u201d   Facts First: This claim remains false. In 2016, Obama\u2019s last calendar year in office, none of these three countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered \u201crecalcitrant\u201d (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.   The Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, noted to CNN in 2019 that in the 2016 fiscal year, ICE reported that Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ranked second, third and fourth for the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. The same was true in the 2017 fiscal year, which encompassed the end of Obama\u2019s presidency and the beginning of Trump\u2019s. ICE did not identify any widespread problems with deportations to these countries.   ICE officials said there were some exceptions to the three countries\u2019 general cooperativeness, but Trump\u2019s general declaration that the countries were uncooperative was never true.   Trump and the word \u2018caravan\u2019   In November speeches in Texas and Florida, Trump spoke of migrant caravans \u2013 and claimed, as he has in the past, that he was the one to come up with the name \u201ccaravan.\u201d   In Florida, he said caravan is \u201ca name I came up with.\u201d In Texas, he said, \u201cI came up with the name. I believe. They\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, it wasn\u2019t really you, it\u2019s somebody,\u2019 but I believe I came up with the name.\u201d   Facts First: Trump did not come up with the word \u201ccaravan,\u201d either in general or to describe groups of migrants traveling together toward the US border during his presidency.   Merriam-Webster says the word caravan \u201ccame to English in the late 16th century, from the Italian caravana, which itself came from the Persian k\u0101rv\u0101n.\u201d   Trump first publicly used a variation of the word as president in a tweet on April 1, 2018 (he wrote, in a tweet about immigration, \u201c\u2019caravans\u2019 coming\u201d). The word had been used by various others in the same context in the days and weeks prior, including in a BuzzFeed News feature article, two days prior to Trump\u2019s tweet, that was headlined, \u201cA Huge Caravan Of Central Americans Is Headed For The US, And No One In Mexico Dares To Stop Them.\u201d   Trump\u2019s claims about Covid-19   Talking about the Covid-19 pandemic, Trump said in an October speech in New Hampshire: \u201cOnce Covid came in from China \u2013 Wuhan. Remember I said it came in from Wuhan. Everyone said, \u2018Why would he say that? It came in from caves.\u2019 First they said it came in from Italy, which was not nice. Then they said it came in from France. Then they said the American soldiers brought it in, and then they admitted it came in from China \u2013 but it came in from Wuhan.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s recounting is inaccurate. It\u2019s not true that, when he said Covid-19 came from Wuhan, \u201ceveryone said, \u2018Why would he say that?\u2019\u201d In reality, when Trump first used the word \u201cWuhan\u201d as president in March 2020, saying the virus came from there was not at all controversial; Trump\u2019s comments came more than two months after Chinese authorities publicly identified Wuhan as the first place it had an outbreak of the novel coronavirus. And in January and February 2020, before Trump started speaking about Wuhan, major media outlets such as CNN\u00a0 and The New York Times referred to the virus as \u201cthe Wuhan coronavirus.\u201d   The situation before Right to Try   In a November speech in Texas, Trump touted the \u201cRight to Try\u201d law he signed in 2018 to give terminally ill patients easier access to experimental medications that haven\u2019t yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration. As he did during his presidency, though, Trump also painted an inaccurate picture of the situation prior to the Right to Try era.   He said, \u201cPeople would be terminally ill. They\u2019d try to get a medicine; they couldn\u2019t get it in this country. It\u2019s totally illegal. If they had money, they\u2019d go to Europe or they\u2019d go to China, go to some of the places where they supposedly had cures. It never worked, by the way, almost never. And they\u2019d end up dying. Sometimes they\u2019d die in foreign lands. If you didn\u2019t have money, you\u2019d go home and you\u2019d die.\u201d   Facts First: It is not true that terminally ill patients would simply have to go home and die without any access to experimental medications or would have to go to foreign countries seeking such treatments until Trump signed the Right to Try. Prior to the law, patients had to ask the federal government for permission to access experimental medications \u2013 but the government almost always said yes.   Scott Gottlieb, who served as Trump\u2019s FDA commissioner, told Congress in 2017 that the FDA had approved 99% of patient requests under its own \u201cexpanded access\u201d program.   \u201cEmergency requests for individual patients are usually granted immediately over the phone and non-emergency requests are generally processed within a few days,\u201d Gottlieb testified.   The Middle East under Trump   Trump said in an October speech in New Hampshire: \u201cLess than four years ago, we had peace in the Middle East with the historic Abraham Accords. Today we have an all-out war in Israel and it\u2019s gonna spread very quickly. What a difference a president makes, isn\u2019t it amazing though?\u201d He said in an October speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition: \u201cThe experts said our pro-Israel policies would produce terror and chaos, but I knew the opposite was true. I turned out to be right.We got the historic Abraham Accords and peace in the Middle East. Peace in the Middle East.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims that there was \u201cpeace in the Middle East\u201d during his presidency and that his administration \u201cgot\u201d peace in the Middle East are both false. Whatever the merits of the Abraham Accords, in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates agreed in 2020 to normalize relations with Israel (Morocco and Sudan followed), there was still lots of unresolved armed conflict around the Middle East \u2013 notably including the conflicts between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, between Israel and Hezbollah on its border with Lebanon, between Israel and Syria, and what former State Department official Aaron David Miller called \u201cthe war between the wars between Israel and Iran on air, land and sea.\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s a highly inaccurate statement,\u201d said Miller, who worked on Mideast peace negotiations while in government and is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.   Miller also noted that various Middle Eastern states were in \u201cvarying phases of dysfunction or failure\u201d at the end of the Trump presidency. As Trump left office, civil wars in Syria and Yemen were ongoing, Libya was precariously emerging from its own civil war, and US forces and diplomats in Iraq continued to be attacked.   Dana El Kurd, senior nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC think tank, also called Trump\u2019s claim \u201cfalse.\u201d She said in an email: \u201cThe Abraham Accords did not achieve peace in the Middle East. In fact, violence escalated in Israel-Palestine in the aftermath of the Accords (using any metric you can think of \u2013 death tolls, settlement violence, etc).\u201d   Trump and wars   Trump claimed in an October speech in Florida that while there are \u201call of these wars\u201d today under Biden, during the Trump presidency, \u201cWe had no wars. I got out of every war. We defeated ISIS, we got out.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that he \u201cgot out of every war\u201d is false. At the end of his presidency, US troops remained in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he had reduced the size of the US presence in all three. And Trump kept a contingent of troops in Syria throughout his presidency, even after he claimed US troops were \u201cout\u201d (other than to protect oil sites, he added); in fact, two US troops died in vehicle rollovers in Syria in 2020.   Trump was also commander-in-chief for US airstrikes, including drone strikes in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.   Trump and Veterans Choice   In a November speech in New Hampshire, Trump claimed, \u201cI also signed \u2013 about 59 years they\u2019ve been trying to get this one \u2013 VA Choice, which made it permanent, so that veterans can get medical care at the private health care provider of their choice.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s \u201c59 years they\u2019ve been trying to get it\u201d claim is false. The Veterans Choice program was actually signed into law in 2014 by his predecessor, Obama. Trump signed a law in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, that expanded and modified the program established under Obama, and, as Trump said, made the initiative permanent. But contrary to Trump\u2019s claim, it\u2019s not true that people had been attempting for decades to create such an initiative.   During Trump\u2019s presidency, he falsely took credit for the Choice law more than 150 times.   Trump\u2019s aid to farmers   In speech after speech, Trump claimed that he had given US farmers $28 billion from China. For example, he claimed in a November speech in New Hampshire, \u201cHow can the farmers vote against me? I got them $28 billion from China.\u201d He added, \u201cI got the money from China out of the tariffs that I got.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are wrong in two ways. First and most critically, this money wasn\u2019t from China. Though the Trump administration made the payments because farmers had been hurt by his trade war with China, the aid money came from US taxpayers: Study after study, including one this year from the federal government\u2019s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, has found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese products. (And it is US importers, not Chinese exporters, who make the actual tariff payments to the government.)\u00a0 Second, as The Washington Post noted in a recent fact check, the payments to farmers under Trump\u2019s program totaled $23 billion, not \u201c$28 billion,\u201d per the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office.   Previous presidents and tariffs on China   In October speeches in Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump boasted of the revenue produced by his tariffs on China and repeated his familiar claim that not a single previous president had gotten China to pay the US \u201c10 cents.\u201d   Facts First: Temporarily leaving aside the fact that Americans, not China, overwhelmingly paid for Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese products, it\u2019s not true no previous president had generated \u201c10 cents\u201d from tariffs on China. The US has had tariffs on goods from China since the late 1700s; Obama imposed new tariffs on goods from China; FactCheck.org reported that the US generated an \u201caverage of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.\u201d   Trump\u2019s aid to the lobster industry   Trump said in an October speech in New Hampshire that, of the money he supposedly secured from China, he \u201cgave the farmers and New England lobstermen $28 billion. You know, I gave your lobstermen $28 billion.\u201d   Facts First: This is false. Trump\u2019s trade-aid package for the seafood industry was a $530 million program covering the entire country. So while it\u2019s not clear how much New England lobstermen in particular ended up receiving, the total was clearly far less than the \u201c$28 billion\u201d he claimed he gave to farmers or the $23 billion he actually did give to farmers. (Lobstermen were not eligible for money from the trade-aid package for farmers.) And it\u2019s worth noting that the money for the seafood industry, like the money for farmers, was compensation for losses incurred because of Trump\u2019s own policies.   China\u2019s oil purchases from Iran under Trump   In speech after speech, Trump told a story about how he supposedly got China to completely stop buying oil from Iran by telling China that if they bought any, the US would no longer do business with China. For example, he said in an October speech in Florida: \u201cI said, \u2018If you buy oil, any oil, from Iran, we\u2019re never doing business. You have all the stuff that you take out of this country and rip us off. We\u2019re not going to do any more business with China.\u2019 They stopped immediately. No more oil.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that China completely stopped buying oil from Iran during his presidency is false. China\u2019s oil imports from Iran did briefly plummet under Trump in 2019, the year the Trump administration made a concerted effort to deter such purchases, but they never stopped \u2013 and then they rose sharply again while Trump was still president. \u201cThe claim is untrue because Chinese crude imports from Iran haven\u2019t stopped at all,\u201d Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at Kpler, a market intelligence firm, said in November.   China\u2019s official statistics recorded no purchases of Iranian crude in Trump\u2019s last partial month in office, January 2021, and also none in most of Biden\u2019s first year in office. But that doesn\u2019t mean China\u2019s imports actually ceased; industry experts say it is widely known that China has used a variety of tactics to mask its continued imports from Iran. Smith said Iranian crude is often listed in Chinese data as being from Malaysia; ships may travel from Iran with their transponders switched off and then turn them on when they are near Malaysia, Smith said, or transfer the Iranian oil to other ships.   Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a November email: \u201cChina significantly reduced its imports from Iran from around 800,000 barrels per day in 2018 to 100,000 in late 2019. But by the time Trump left office, they were back to upwards to 600(000)-700,000 barrels.\u201d   Vaez\u2019s comments were corroborated by Kpler data Smith provided to CNN. Kpler found that China imported about 511,000 barrels per day of Iranian crude in December 2020, Trump\u2019s last full month in office. The low point under Trump was March 2020, when global oil demand crashed because of Covid-19. Even then, China imported about 87,000 barrels per day, Kpler found. (Since data on Iranian oil exports is based on cargo tracking by various companies and groups, other entities may have different data.)   Iran\u2019s oil sales under Trump and Biden   Trump claimed in an October speech in Florida that Biden\u2019s soft approach to sanctions on Iran \u201callowed them to sell massive amounts of oil, making them $80 billion a year. Congratulations; they were making nothing with us.\u201d   Facts First: Both of Trump\u2019s claims \u2013 that Iran is making $80 billion a year from oil sales under Biden and that it was making \u201cnothing\u201d from these sales under Trump \u2013 are false.   The federal government\u2019s Energy Information Administration reported that Iran generated an approximate total of $110 billion in net oil export revenues in 2021, 2022 and the first five months of 2023. The 2021 figure was $37 billion and the 2022 figure was $54 billion. That\u2019s not \u201c$80 billion a year.\u201d   Similarly, the conservative Washington Free Beacon reported in October that the group United Against a Nuclear Iran had calculated that Iran had generated about $80 billion in oil sales over the course of the Biden administration. The group confirmed to CNN in November that this $80 billion was for the period from February 2021 to September 2023, not for a single year alone.   And Iran made money from oil exports under Trump as well. Data provided to CNN by the Energy Information Administration shows that Iran had $55 billion in net oil export revenues in 2017, $66 billion in 2018, $29 billion in 2019 and $16 billion in 2020.   Groceries and identification   In an October speech in Iowa, Trump reprised a claim for which he was widely mocked during his presidency \u2013 his assertion that Americans are required to show identification to buy groceries. \u201cIf you buy a loaf of bread, you gotta have your ID out, but for voting, you don\u2019t,\u201d Trump said.   Facts First: Trump remains wrong. Americans do not need to show identification to buy bread or other foods.   Grocery stores generally require identification for purchases of alcohol or tobacco, for purchases of certain medications and for the small percentage of purchases made with a check. They may sometimes ask for ID when customers are using credit cards.\u00a0 But those are exceptions rather than the rule. Contrary to Trump\u2019s declarations, Americans can and do purchase loaves of bread, and otherwise fill their grocery bags with food, without ever having to tell anyone who they are \u2013 much less show official proof of identity.   The legitimacy of the 2020 election   In speech after speech, Trump claimed the 2020 presidential election was \u201crigged\u201d or \u201cstolen,\u201d sometimes specifying that \u201cradical left Democrats\u201d rigged the election and once saying \u201cthey cheated like a bunch of dogs.\u201d   Facts First: These claims are all false. The 2020 election was not rigged, Trump lost fair and square to Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232, and there is no evidence of any fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state.   The 2020 vote count   In October and November speeches in New Hampshire and a November speech in Florida, Trump rejected the legitimacy of the vote count in the 2020 presidential election He said in New Hampshire in November: \u201cI got 75 million votes, I got \u2013 and that\u2019s their count, OK, which is a phony count.\u201d He said in Florida in November: \u201cI went from 63 million to, I believe, over 75 million \u2013 and that\u2019s been recorded by them, not by me. How about the real number?\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim of a \u201cphony count\u201d is false, as is his suggestion that the official numbers are not the \u201creal number.\u201d The vote count was legitimate and accurate.   A minor side note: Trump got 74,223,975 votes, not \u201cover 75 million\u201d; Biden got 81,283,501.   Election Night in 2020   Falsely claiming that he watched the 2020 election get \u201cstolen,\u201d Trump said in a November speech in Florida that, on Election Night, \u201cat 9 o\u2019clock it was over, 10 o\u2019clock it was really over\u201d \u2013 suggesting, as he has repeatedly before, that he had been shown to be the winner at those times. He added, \u201cAnd then\u2026\u2019We have found some additional votes.\u2019\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. The 2020 election was not \u201cover\u201d at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. on November 3, when millions of legitimate votes still needed to be counted \u2013 and it was widely known in the lead-up to Election Day that some states\u2019 early results might create the illusion that Trump had big leads, since it would take time to count the mail-in votes that tended to heavily favor Biden (in part because Trump had spent months disparaging mail-in voting). Some populous urban areas, which also tended to support Biden, also took a while to finish their counting simply because they had so many votes.   Trump has been making similar false claims since Election Night 2020 itself, when he wrongly claimed that he had won Georgia and won Michigan as votes continued to be counted. Trump ended up losing both states.   A film about the 2020 election   Repeating his false claim that the 2020 election was rigged, Trump claimed in a November speech in Iowa: \u201cWe don\u2019t even have to go into all of the ballot-stuffing that is on tape from the \u20182000 Mules.\u2019 You look at \u20182000 Mules\u2019 and you see thousands and thousands \u2013 hundreds of thousands actually \u2013 of votes being stuffed into ballot boxes.\u201d   Facts First: This is false. The film \u20182000 Mules\u2019 has been widely debunked, and it doesn\u2019t show thousands of votes, let alone hundreds of thousands, \u201cbeing stuffed into ballot boxes.\u201d   The film, which is filled with misleading claims and dubious analysis, focuses on footage of ballots being submitted into drop boxes in public places (after which they are put through various verification measures to make sure they are legitimate), not into ballot boxes at in-person voting centers where ballots are placed for final counting \u2013 and, regardless, the film fails to prove any widespread wrongdoing even involving the drop boxes.   The security of mail-in ballots   Trump said in a November speech in Florida, \u201cAnytime you have mail-in ballots, you have corrupt elections. I don\u2019t care what it is. Anybody that wants it, they\u2019re corrupt. And that includes Republicans, by the way. Anytime you have mail-in ballots, you are going to have really corrupt elections.\u201d   Facts First: This is all false. While elections experts say the occurrence of fraud is relatively higher with mail-in ballots than with in-person voting, they also say that fraud of any kind in American state and federal elections represents a miniscule percentage of total votes cast. Voters have been casting ballots by mail for decades, including in Republican-dominated states; there is nothing inherently corrupt about supporting the use of such ballots.   \u2018Fake ballots\u2019   In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump said the only way he can be beaten in the November 2024 election is \u201cif they cheat.\u201d He added moments later, \u201cThe biggest problem is they make fake ballots. Okay? That\u2019s the biggest problem. And a lot of Republicans are very naive when they don\u2019t say that. They say, \u2018Oh, vote early. Vote early. We want to build\u2026\u2019 No, no: the big problem we have to do, we gotta stop fake ballots from being made.\u201d   Facts First: This is entirely baseless. Federal elections do not have any \u201cbig problem\u201d with \u201cfake ballots.\u201d Every state has numerous safeguards in place to ensure that someone who tries to manufacture and use a phony ballot will be caught.   What a Jimmy Carter commission said   Criticizing the use of mail-in ballots, Trump invoked a commission on election reform that was co-chaired by former Democratic President Jimmy Carter.   Trump said in a November speech in Florida that Carter \u201chad a commission with some other prominent senators, and they came to one conclusion: you can\u2019t do mail-in ballots.\u201d Trump said in a November speech in New Hampshire: \u201cEven Jimmy Carter, he had a commission. He said if you have mail-in ballots, you\u2019re going to have massive corruption.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims significantly exaggerated what Carter\u2019s commission said.Though the commission Carter co-chaired was generally skeptical of mail-in ballots, it did not say \u201cyou can\u2019t do mail-in ballots\u201d or that \u201cmassive corruption\u201d is inevitable with the use of mail-in ballots; in fact, it highlighted an example of successful mail-only elections.   The commission\u2019s 2005 report said that \u201cabsentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud.\u201d It also said mail-in voting increases the risks of fraud and that absentee ballots are \u201cvulnerable to abuse in several ways.\u201d   But it did not say all mail-in voting should be prohibited. It said that Oregon, a state that has been conducting elections exclusively by mail-in voting since the late 1990s, \u201cappears to have avoided significant fraud in its vote-by-mail elections by introducing safeguards to protect ballot integrity, including signature verification.\u201d The report also offered some recommendations for making the use of mail-in ballots more secure and called for \u201cfurther research on the pros and cons\u201d of voting by mail (as well as early voting).   Fifteen years after the release of the report, Carter said in a 2020 statement: \u201cI approve the use of absentee ballots and have been using them for more than five years.\u201d His organization, The Carter Center, said in a 2020 statement: \u201cFortunately, since 2005, many states have gained substantial experience in vote-by-mail and have shown how key concerns can be effectively addressed through appropriate planning, resources, training, and messaging.\u201d   Democrats and elections   Trump claimed in an October speech in New Hampshire that Democrats can\u2019t win legitimately, given their policy preferences, and \u201cthe only way they know how to win is by cheating.\u201d   Facts First: This is false. Just like Republicans, Democrats have won elections around the country \u2013 including the 2020 presidential election \u2013 fair and square. There is simply no basis for Trump\u2019s claim.   Trump\u2019s 2016 margin in Alabama   In a November speech in Florida, Trump spoke of how some of his opponents claimed that the 2016 election he won was rigged. He then said, \u201cIn 2016, they even tried to get me on Alabama and I won it by like 45 points. They said, \u2018He cheated on Alabama.\u2019 I said, \u2018I won it by 45 points, I must have cheated by a lot.\u2019\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that he won Alabama by 45 percentage points in 2016 is false \u2013 a major exaggeration. His margin over Hillary Clinton was big, but it was about 27.8 points (62.08% to 34.36%), not 45 points.   It\u2019s not clear who he was claiming had accused him of cheating to win Alabama.   Maricopa County in 2022   In a November speech in Florida, Trump mentioned Kari Lake, a Republican US Senate candidate in Arizona who ran unsuccessfully for Arizona governor in 2022. He made reference to a technology problem that marred Election Day 2022 in Arizona\u2019s most populous county, Maricopa County, saying that \u201cunfortunately over 50% of the machines, in the Republican areas only, didn\u2019t work. So they always find something.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s specifics were wrong: the Maricopa County technology problem affected about 27% of its voting locations \u2013 and these locations were scattered around the county, in heavily Democratic areas as well as Republican areas, a Washington Post analysis found. And Trump\u2019s suggestion that the technology problems were intentionally designed to damage Republicans is baseless. At the time, Maricopa County had a Republican-controlled board of supervisors and a Republican county recorder.   \u201cWe were having these issues coming up around Maricopa County,\u201d Bill Gates, the Republican chairman of the board of supervisors, told reporters at the time. Noting the Republican affiliations of the recorder and the majority of the board, Gates said, \u201cSo there was no partisan bias in what happened here. This was a technical issue.\u201d   Chris Wallace and a 2020 debate   In two October speeches in New Hampshire and October and November speeches in Florida, Trump told a story in which he claimed that 2020 presidential debate moderator Chris Wallace, who was then a host for Fox News and is now a host for CNN, had tried to stop him from asking Biden a question about a supposed payment from the wife of the mayor of Moscow to Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden.   \u201cChris Wallace said, \u2018He\u2019s not allowed to answer that question,\u2018\u201d Trump said in one of the New Hampshire speeches; in the other, he said Wallace said \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to ask that question\u201d and told him \u201cit\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d In Florida in November, Trump said, \u201cBiden couldn\u2019t answer the question, but Chris Wallace came in and helped him. \u2018You\u2019re not allowed to ask that question.\u2019\u201d   Facts First: All of these Trump claims are false. Wallace did not tell him that he was not allowed to ask the question or that Biden was not allowed to answer it.Rather, as the transcript shows, Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to allow Biden to answer the question after Trump had asked it, rather than continue to speak when Biden tried to offer a response. Wallace never said the question was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d   Rather, Wallace made comments like, \u201cSir, you\u2019ve asked him a question, let him answer it\u201d and, \u201cWell, you have raised an issue, let the vice president answer.\u201d   Climate change and sea levels   In a November speech in Florida, Trump delivered another version of a familiar claim he has used to minimize the threat of climate change. He said that others, rather than talk about the potentially catastrophic threat of nuclear weapons, instead \u201ctalk about global warming \u2013 because in 250 years our ocean\u2019s gonna be a hundredth of an inch higher.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that the ocean will be just a hundredth of an inch higher \u201cin 250 years\u201d is false. As the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has noted, the global sea level is currently rising at a rate of about an eighth of an inch per year. In other words, the sea level rise Trump claimed will happen \u201cin 250 years\u201d is already being vastly exceeded on an annual basis. NOAA says that, along the US coastline in particular, sea level rise is expected to average a total of 10 to 12 inches between 2020 and 2050 alone.   Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge   In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump criticized Biden for canceling Trump-era oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He said, \u201cCan you believe that? It was so much work to get that approved. We got it approved. They were ready to start drilling.\u201d   Facts First: It\u2019s not true that anybody was \u201cready to start drilling\u201d in the refuge, either before the Biden administration suspended leases there in 2021 or before the administration canceled leases in 2023. There is no drilling infrastructure in place in the refuge, major oil companies have shown little interest in the site, and the seven leases the Biden administration canceled were all held by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state entity that is not an oil company. \u201cTo quote our friends at PolitiFact, what Trump said in this case qualifies as \u2018pants on fire,\u2019\u201d Pavel Molchanov, an energy analyst at Raymond James & Associates, said in a November email. He said, \u201cNo one was ready to start drilling there, in 2017 or at any other point in time.\u201d   Molchanov explained that the idea of drilling in the refuge would be a textbook example of \u201cfrontier exploration,\u201d drilling in an area that has no previous activity by the oil industry. \u201cThis means there is no first-hand knowledge of how to go about drilling there. Everything would have to be learned along the way. This translates into lengthy time for preparation and elevated costs for actual drilling, if and when it were to take place. Also, there is no infrastructure \u2013 it would have to be developed from scratch.\u201d   Tim Woody, communications manager for the Alaska regional office of The Wilderness Society conservation group, also called Trump\u2019s claim false and noted \u201cthere is no infrastructure in place\u201d in the refuge. And Woody said that no company had \u201cgone through any of the steps that occur between acquiring a lease and actually beginning development,\u201d including conducting seismic analysis and obtaining permits.   Demand for electric cars   In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump said, \u201cCan you believe what we\u2019re doing with the electric cars? All electric. Nobody wants them.\u201d   Facts First: It\u2019s not true that \u201cnobody wants\u201d electric cars. US purchases of electric vehicles continue to set records; Cox Automotive reported in October that \u201cEV sales have now increased for 13 straight quarters\u201d in the US and were \u201cfirmly on track to surpass 1 million for the first time ever\u201d in a year. Electric vehicle sales also make up a growing share of total US vehicle sales; Cox Automotive reported that they accounted for a record 7.9% of total sales in the third quarter of 2023, up from 6.1% a year prior and up from 7.2% in the second quarter of this year.   A Pew Research Center survey earlier this year found that 38% of Americans said they are very likely or somewhat likely to seriously consider an electric vehicle for their next vehicle purchase. Even if the poll result is off, it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cnobody wants them\u201d is not true.   The US and electric car manufacturing   Trump, saying he thinks he will earn the support of union autoworkers, claimed in a November speech in Iowa that it is \u201cpreposterous\u201d for the US move to all electric cars \u2013 and then said, \u201cYou can\u2019t make them here, because we don\u2019t have the minerals, we don\u2019t have the materials for it. We have a thing called gasoline, that\u2019s what we have.\u201d   Facts First: It\u2019s not true that \u201cyou can\u2019t\u201d make electric cars in the US. Electric cars are already being assembled here by various companies. And domestic electric vehicle manufacturing is expected to grow substantially: companies have made major recent investments in US factories to assemble electric vehicles and make batteries for them, spurred in part by provisions of Biden\u2019s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.Many of the recent investments have been in Republican-led states in the South.   While the US does need to import some critical minerals and materials for electric vehicle manufacturing, that clearly doesn\u2019t mean domestic production of the vehicles is impossible. There are global supply chains for all sorts of products whose final assembly is done in this country.   - CNN\u2019s Ella Nilsen contributed to this item.   Biden and electric vehicles   Trump claimed in an October speech in New Hampshire: \u201cOn day one, I will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s insane electric vehicle mandate. \u2018Everybody has to have an electric car.\u2019\u201d He said that, in a second Trump administration, \u201cgasoline-powered engines will be allowed.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. Biden has not mandated that \u201ceverybody has to have an electric car\u201d or outlawed cars powered by gasoline, though his administration has made an aggressive push to try to get automakers and consumers to move toward electric vehicles.   The Biden administration has proposed ambitious new tailpipe emissions regulations for automakers, offered tax credits to people who buy certain electric vehicles, invested in new electric vehicle charging stations and ordered federal entities to purchase electric vehicles, among other policies promoting the adoption of these vehicles. But there is no Biden requirement that \u201ceverybody\u201d has to drive an electric vehicle and no Biden proposal to prohibit citizens from continuing to use gasoline-powered engines.   Depending on how automakers were to respond, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s proposed new tailpipe rules could, if adopted, require electric vehicles to make up two-thirds of new cars sold in the US by 2032.   Electric vehicles and the military   In a November speech in Texas, Trump criticized the Biden administration for imposing \u201cinsane mandates\u201d and lamented that \u201cArmy tanks have to go electric, OK?\u2026Because the tanks, if they\u2019re electric, you\u2019re going into a country blasting the hell out of it, but at least we\u2019re doing it in an environmentally friendly way.\u201d   Facts First: This is false. The Biden administration is not requiring tanks to be all-electric, as FactCheck.org pointed out in its own November fact check.The Army released a climate strategy in 2022 that called for a move toward various kinds of electric vehicles, including \u201cfully electric tactical vehicles by 2050,\u201d but that would not include tanks. And, regardless, a strategy is not a mandate.   Biden and boats   During the same part of the Texas speech, Trump also claimed that \u201call boats have to go electric.\u201d   Facts First: This is false. There is no Biden mandate requiring boats to be powered by electricity, as The New York Times noted in its own fact check of this Trump speech.   A federal boat speed limit   After complaining in an October speech in New Hampshire about offshore wind turbines, and alleging without evidence that these turbines are killing whales, Trump added, \u201cThen they say that, for boat manufacturers, the boat can\u2019t go more than two miles an hour because we don\u2019t want to hurt the whales.\u201d   Facts First: This claim is false in two ways.   To try to protect whales, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has proposed to require a greater number of boats to abide by a speed limit in certain areas of the East Coast during certain months of the year; the expansion would apply the speed limit to boats at least 35 feet long rather than the current minimum of 65 feet long.   But Trump\u2019s \u201ctwo miles an hour\u201d claim is not true. The speed limit involved is 10 knots, or roughly 11.5 miles per hour. Second, the speed limit applies to people operating boats, not to \u201cboat manufacturers\u201d as Trump said. In other words, the government is not trying to force companies to make boats that cannot go faster than this speed limit.   In other recent speeches, Trump has attributed his two-miles-per-hour claim to something he said he was told while visiting a boat company in South Carolina in September. That company and South Carolina\u2019s boating industry advocacy group did not respond to CNN requests for comment.   California and electricity   Criticizing Democrats\u2019 push for the adoption of electric vehicles, Trump repeatedly claimed that California already has constant blackouts because it has insufficient power to serve its population.   He said in a November speech in Texas: \u201cDid you see, they had blackouts all over the place this summer?\u201d He said in an October speech in New Hampshire: \u201cIn California, they want to go with all-electric, but they can\u2019t even \u2013 every weekend, they have a blackout. They don\u2019t have enough electricity.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims that California \u201chad blackouts all over the place this summer\u201d and has a blackout \u201cevery weekend\u201d are false. California has been able to meet its electricity demand throughout the year, including during the peak-demand summer season.   \u201cCalifornia didn\u2019t experience any outages this year because of a load imbalance. We haven\u2019t since 2020,\u201d Erin Mellon, spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, said in an email earlier in November. Mellon added, \u201cWe\u2019ve drastically expanded our clean energy portfolio, and recently CA hit 6,600 MW of battery storage \u2013 enough for 6.6 million homes for 4 hours.\u201d   Vonette Fontaine, spokesperson for the California Independent System Operator, which manages the power grid for about 80% of the state, said in an email earlier in November: \u201cThe California Independent System Operator did not experience any grid emergencies this summer requiring electricity outages.\u201d   You can read more here.   - CNN\u2019s Ella Nilsen contributed to this item.   Biden and energy production   Trump claimed in an October speech in New Hampshire that, with regard to US energy production, Biden \u201cstopped it \u2013 just no more.\u201d In an October speech in Iowa, he more specifically accused Biden of stopping energy production from fossil fuels, saying, \u201cBiden \u2013 by stopping all the energy coming out \u2013 you know, he wants to put windmills all over the place and he wants to do things that are very expensive, but he doesn\u2019t want any petroleum, he doesn\u2019t want any petroleum product, and he doesn\u2019t want oil and gas.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are false. Biden has not stopped US production of oil and gas, which has continued to boom under Biden. US crude oil production in 2022 was the second-highest year on record, behind only Trump-era 2019, and domestic crude production in the first eight months of 2023, the most recent data that is currently available, was the highest on record for the first eight months of any year.   As CNN\u2019s Matt Egan reported in August, the federal government\u2019s Energy Information Administration is projecting annual records for both 2023 and 2024. US production of dry natural gas also set a record in 2022 and outpaced 2022 levels in the first eight months of 2023.   None of this is to say that Biden is the reason that domestic production has increased; market factors are the key driver of companies\u2019 investment and production decisions. (\u201cIt\u2019s perhaps less about the administration in power and more about the entrepreneurial nature of the oil industry,\u201d Matt Smith, Kpler\u2019s lead oil analyst for the Americas, told Egan.) And Egan wrote: \u201cThe American Petroleum Institute, an oil trade group that has been critical of the Biden administration\u2019s regulatory efforts, noted that approved federal permits and new federal acres leased have both fallen sharply under Biden.\u201d   Still, despite Biden\u2019s often critical rhetoric about fossil fuel companies, some policy moves to get tougher on those companies and his major investments in initiatives to fight climate change, he certainly has not \u201cstopped it.\u201d   Biden has also approved some significant and controversial fossil fuel projects, including the Willow oil drilling project in Alaska and the Mountain Valley gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia.   Biden and oil exports to Europe   Trump said in a November speech in Texas: \u201cWe\u2019re going to supply Europe, all over the world. We were going to send our oil and gas. And then they ended it, they ended it.\u201d   Facts First: This is false. Biden did not end oil and gas exports to Europe or the rest of the world. In fact, the federal government\u2019s Energy Information Administration reported in October that US crude oil exports in the first half of 2023 were the highest on record since the ban on these exports was repealed in 2015 \u2013 and that \u201cEurope was the largest regional destination for U.S. crude oil exports by volume, at 1.75 million\u201d barrels per day. Also, the Energy Information Administration reported in September that European Union countries and the United Kingdom \u201cremained the main destination\u201d for US exports of liquefied natural gas after reaching that status in 2022.   Oil prices   Talking about oil prices, Trump claimed in an October 9 speech in New Hampshire: \u201cNow it\u2019s $100 and going higher.\u201d He claimed in a speech in Florida two days later: \u201cWe\u2019re hitting $100 now, and we\u2019re going to probably hit $115 a barrel.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims that \u201cnow it\u2019s $100\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019re hitting $100 now\u201d are false, both exaggerations. On the days he spoke, West Texas Intermediate crude did not exceed $87.24 per barrel and Brent crude did not exceed $89 per barrel. While Brent crude briefly passed $97 per barrel in late September, it had fallen substantially by the time Trump made this claim.   Some analysts have said in recent months that oil could potentially exceed the $100 per barrel mark next year. But Trump used the word \u201cnow,\u201d twice, and that\u2019s not true.   Energy costs   Trump claimed in a November speech in Florida: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna bring down your costs. We are bringing down your energy costs. We have the highest energy costs anywhere now.\u201d   Facts First: It\u2019s not true that the US now has the highest energy costs \u201canywhere.\u201d Even with an increase in the Biden era, US household electricity prices have remained substantially lower than prices in many European countries, plus a variety of other nations. Pavel Molchanov, the Raymond James energy analyst, said in an email that Trump\u2019s claim is not even close to correct; citing data you can see here, he said, \u201cU.S. electricity prices are lower than in practically every other industrialized economy.\u201d (US household prices for natural gas are also nowhere near the world\u2019s highest.)   The state of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve   Criticizing Biden for releasing a large quantity of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2022, Trump said, \u201cNow it\u2019s at the lowest level\u2026the lowest level in history. There\u2019s almost nothing there.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cthere\u2019s almost nothing there\u201d is false. Though the reserve is at its lowest level since the early 1980s, it still has more than 351 million barrels of crude and is still the world\u2019s largest national oil reserve. Three-hundred-fifty-one million barrels is just not \u201calmost nothing\u201d by any reasonable standard. (Trump has previously claimed this year that the reserve is now \u201ctotally empty.\u201d)   Wind turbines and house values   In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump railed once more against wind turbines, a longtime subject of his criticism. This time, he said, \u201cIf you have one near your house, your house is worthless, because you can\u2019t sell it. Between the noise and the look, you can\u2019t sell it.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cyour house is worthless\u201d if a wind turbine is nearby is not true, though there may be some cases where people have more trouble selling their house because of a nearby wind turbine. Various US studies have found either no statistically significant impact on house values or even an increase in house values related to the proximity of wind power.   Even if there was a decline in house values in some neighborhoods or counties because of nearby wind turbines, that wouldn\u2019t justify Trump\u2019s categorical claim that a nearby wind turbine makes your house \u201cworthless.\u201d   Gas prices   Trump made repeated false claims in October and November about how much gas cost at the time.   For example, he said in an October 16 speech in Iowa that gasoline \u201cjust hit $5.50 a gallon\u201d after being $1.87 or lower under Trump. He also made the claim about having had gas at $1.87 in an October 11 speech in Florida \u2013 and said that \u201ctoday, you have $5, $6 and $7.\u201d In a November 11 speech in New Hampshire, Trump again boasted of low gas prices during his tenure and said, \u201cAnd now you have $5 gasoline.\u201d And in the October 16 speech in Iowa, Trump also said that, in California, gasoline is \u201cup to $7 and $8\u201d per gallon.   Facts First: These Trump claims are all false.   On the day he spoke in Iowa and said prices had \u201cjust hit $5.50 a gallon,\u201d the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in Iowa was about $3.29, and the national average was about $3.60, per data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at the firm GasBuddy, said that, on the day Trump spoke, GasBuddy did not see gas being sold for $5 or more per gallon at any of the 2,036 stations it tracks in Iowa.   On the day he spoke in Florida and said that today\u2019s prices were $5, $6 and $7, the state\u2019s average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $3.42 per gallon, and the national average was about $3.66 per gallon, according to data provided by AAA. De Haan said none of the 8,237 Florida stations tracked by GasBuddy were selling for $5 or higher that day.   On the day he spoke in New Hampshire and said that \u201cnow you have $5 gasoline,\u201d the state\u2019s average for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $3.34, while the national average was about $3.38, according to data provided by AAA. De Haan said none of the 875 New Hampshire stations tracked by GasBuddy were selling for $5 or higher that day.   And when he made the claim about California prices going up to $7 and $8, the state\u2019s average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $5.62; De Haan said that, of 10,526 California stations tracked by GasBuddy, the firm did not see a single station selling that day at $8 per gallon or higher, with only four, well known for their high prices, at $7 or higher. Just four stations in California \u2013 two rural, two in Los Angeles \u2013 were selling for over $7 per gallon that day.   Also, Trump\u2019s claim about having had gas at $1.87 is misleading.While the national average did go that low and lower after gasoline demand crashed in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the national average was $2.393 per gallon on the day Trump left office in January 2021.   Venezuelan oil and US refineries   In October speeches in Iowa and New Hampshire and in a November speech in Houston, Trump spoke of the US importing heavy, sour crude oil from Venezuela under Biden after imports stopped under Trump as a result of his sanctions.He claimed in Iowa that Houston has \u201cthe only refineries in the entire world\u201d that can refine the oil, and claimed in New Hampshire that Houston has \u201cthe only refinery in the world that can do it.\u201d In the speech in Houston, he claimed the city has the \u201conly one refinery in the country that can refine\u201d it.   Facts First: It\u2019s not true that Houston has the only refinery or refineries \u2013 in the US or the world \u2013 that can refine oil from Venezuela. Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at Kpler, provided CNN with a chart of US refineries that have taken Venezuelan crude this year; they include facilities in Mississippi, Louisiana and elsewhere in Texas.   - CNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed to this item.   The Keystone XL pipeline and jobs   Criticizing Biden for canceling the permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada in 2021, Trump said in a November speech in Texas, \u201cForty-eight thousand jobs, 48,000 people. They gave their life for that, and they never really sort of recovered. That\u2019s what they wanted to do.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that 48,000 people \u201cgave their life\u201d for Keystone XL jobs is false. The company behind the pipeline said after Biden\u2019s cancellation decision that it would cut 1,000 unionized jobs in Canada and the US as a result.   A 2014 report from the Obama administration\u2019s State Department had estimated that \u201ca total of 42,100 jobs throughout the United States would be supported by construction of the proposed Project.\u201d But that\u2019s still not 48,000, and it doesn\u2019t mean that 42,100 people were actually working on the project in 2021.   The key word is \u201csupported.\u201d The 42,100-jobs estimate wasn\u2019t an estimate of people who would actually be devoting their workdays to the pipeline. It included an estimated 26,000 jobs that would supposedly have resulted \u201cfrom indirect and induced spending\u201d by people connected to the project, like spending by employees of construction contractors or suppliers.   China and the Paris climate accord   In a November speech in Texas, Trump criticized the Paris climate accord, calling it \u201cone of the greatest rip-offs.\u201d As he did as president, he also made false claims about China in relation to the accord \u2013 saying this time that \u201cChina was exempt\u201d from the accord. He added, \u201cChina didn\u2019t have to do anything until 2035, think of it.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are false.   China was not \u201cexempt\u201d from the Paris accord; the agreement came into effect for all participating countries, including China, in November 2016. The accord simply allowed each nation to set its own targets for reducing carbon emissions.   And though China picked approximately 2030 as the time by which it planned to have carbon emissions peak (later saying the goal was to hit the peak before 2030), that did not mean China didn\u2019t have to do anything until 2030, much less not do anything until 2035. Similarly, when the Obama administration set a target of reducing US emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2025, that did not mean that the US was exempt or didn\u2019t have to do anything until 2025.   China has made massive investments in wind and solar energy since its commitment to the Paris accord \u2013 while also drawing criticism from environmentalists for ramping up its use of coal.   Military equipment left in Afghanistan   Trump said in speech after speech that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021.   Facts First: Trump\u2019s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion \u2013 a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.   As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the \u201c$85 billion\u201d is a rounded-up figure (it\u2019s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment.   Guns and Afghanistan   Trump claimed in a November speech in New Hampshire that the US had left \u201c700,000 rifles\u201d to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. In an October speech in Florida, he said it was \u201c700,000 guns and rifles.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s \u201c700,000\u201d figure is inaccurate, an exaggeration. An inspector general report to Congress in 2022 said: \u201cSince 2005, the DoD procured 427,300 weapons worth $612 million for the Afghan military and security forces, including 258,300 rifles, 6,300 sniper rifles, 64,300 pistols, 56,155 machine guns, 31,000 rocket propelled grenade launchers, and 224 howitzers. [The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy] noted that 316,260 of these weapons, worth $511.8 million, were in the Afghan forces\u2019 stocks when the former government fell, but their operational condition was unknown.\u201d   China and Taiwan   In a November speech in Florida, Trump claimed of China: \u201cThe day I left, they flew 28 bombers right over the middle of Taiwan, because that was a signal.\u201d   Facts First: Trump was wrong about key details of this incident. On the third and fourth days of the Biden presidency, not the very day Trump left office, China sent military planes into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone over the Taiwan Strait \u2013 not \u201cright over the middle of Taiwan,\u201d a major difference. And the incident involved 28 Chinese planes but not \u201c28 bombers\u201d; The New York Times reported at the time that the Taiwanese military said eight Chinese bombers were involved; the other planes were fighters, anti-submarine aircraft and a reconnaissance plane.   It\u2019s worth noting that China also sent planes into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone during Trump\u2019s presidency. In early 2021, Taiwan News reported that, according to a recent report funded by Taiwan\u2019s government, \u201cIn 2020, the Chinese military violated Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) more times than in any year since 1996.\u201d   US alliances under Biden   Trump claimed in an October speech in New Hampshire that, under Biden, \u201cRelations with other countries \u2013 we\u2019ve lost every country; we don\u2019t even have any allies anymore, they don\u2019t respect us. I mean, we don\u2019t have any. We have nothing going. You take a look, and China is our best ally, I think, with him.\u201d   Facts First: Both of these Trump claims are false. The US continues to have numerous allies around the world and continues to have numerous points of friction with China. There is simply no basis for claiming that China, which Biden describes as a competitor to the US, has become the closest US ally under Biden. \u201cChina is a strong trading partner with the US, but it is as far from an ally a country can be,\u201d said Krista Wiegand, director of the University of Tennessee\u2019s Center for National Security and Foreign Affairs.   Wiegand said: \u201cFrom the beginning of his administration, Biden has worked hard to repair relations with US allies that were weekend under the Trump administration. US relations with its allies are closer than they have been in years especially in the Indo-Pacific region.\u201d   Netanyahu and the assassination of an Iranian general   In an October speech in Florida, Trump criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for supposedly pulling Israel out from its planned involvement in the Trump-ordered 2020 assassination of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Then, using Netanyahu\u2019s nickname, Trump said: \u201cAnd then Bibi tried to take credit for it. That wasn\u2019t good. That didn\u2019t make me feel too good. But that\u2019s alright.\u201d   Facts First: Netanyahu did not try to take credit for the 2020 assassination of Soleimani. In fact, he explicitly said the day of the assassination that \u201cPresident Trump deserves all the credit\u201d \u2013 emphasizing the \u201call\u201d \u2013 \u201cfor acting swiftly, forcefully, decisively.\u201d   NBC News reported in 2020 that Israeli intelligence had played a role in the killing; the former head of Israeli military intelligence said the same in 2021. But Netanyahu has not made such comments himself, let alone take credit for the killing itself. The Jerusalem Post reported in 2022 that \u201calthough NBC News and Yahoo News had published detailed pieces about Israel\u2019s role, all official Israeli echelons had been mum on the issue\u201d until the former intelligence chief spoke out.   Iran\u2019s retaliation for Soleimani\u2019s death   In various speeches, Trump hinted or explicitly claimed that Iran intentionally avoided hitting a base that housed US troops in Iraq when Iran launched missiles toward the base in January 2020 in retaliation for the assassination of Soleimani.   In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump said the missiles \u201call landed a little outside the base\u201d and that Iran \u201cneeded some kind of reply, I guess, but they didn\u2019t hit us.\u201d In a November speech in Houston, he claimed that Iran had called the US to assure them that none of the missiles would strike the base, and indeed all of the missiles either blew up before arrival or landed \u201coutside the base area.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims that all of Iran\u2019s missiles landed outside the base are false. As The Washington Post noted in its own recent fact check, 11 Iranian missiles hit the al-Asad base Iran had targeted in the retaliatory attack. The fact that missiles hit the base was confirmed by satellite images, by the Pentagon, and by a CNN visit to the base days after the attack. CNN reported from the scene: \u201cTen of the 11 missiles struck US positions at the sprawling desert Iraqi airbase. One struck a remote location on the Iraqi military\u2019s side.\u201d CNN reported that \u201cthe Iranian missiles, which used on-board guidance systems, managed to shred sensitive US military sites, damaging a special forces compound, and two hangars, in addition to the US drone operators\u2019 housing unit.\u201d   While no US troops were killed, more than 100 were diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injuries. Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, told reporters that he believed Iran\u2019s intent was to kill; he credited \u201cthe defensive techniques that our forces used\u201d for the absence of deaths.   Trump has provided no substantiation for the claim that Iran called the US to telegraph the strike and offer reassurance; as the Post reported, Iraq\u2019s prime minister said he received a general warning from Iran that it was about to begin its response and target US troops.   Trump\u2019s claim that Israel had abandoned the assassination operation has also been disputed.   What the Biden administration said about Israel and Hezbollah   Trump repeatedly claimed that a top Biden national security official, or multiple officials, had foolishly said that they hoped Hezbollah did not attack Israel from the north because Israel is especially \u201cvulnerable\u201d there.   For example, Trump said in an October speech in New Hampshire:  \u201cHow about the person, the security person, top security person for Biden, said, \u2018I hope Hezbollah doesn\u2019t attack us from the north because that\u2019s where we\u2019re most vulnerable.\u2019 Can you believe it? The following morning, we get attacked from the north. No, can you believe the guy, he\u2019s a national security advisor. \u2018I hope that Hezbollah doesn\u2019t attack Israel from the north because that\u2019s where we\u2019re the most vulnerable.\u2019 The following morning they got attacked. But this is what we\u2019re dealing with. We\u2019re dealing with stupid people.\u201d   Facts First: Trump was misstating what Biden administration officials said. They did urge Hezbollah to refrain from attacking Israel from Lebanon after Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza, and expressed \u201cconcern\u201d about the possibility of a Hezbollah attack \u2013 but contrary to a central component of Trump\u2019s stories, they did not say Israel is \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d in the north.   Asked what Trump was referring to when he made these claims, campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung pointed to October comments from National Security Council spokesman John Kirby and a senior defense official who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity. But neither of them said what Trump claimed.   Cheung pointed to this comment from Kirby at an October 11 press briefing: \u201cAnd, you know, we\u2019ve been watching with concern some of the rocket attacks that have come across the northern border of Israel from Lebanon, which obviously were coming from \u2013 from Hezbollah. So we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re clearly concerned about that.\u201d   But Kirby said nothing there about the north being a particular vulnerability for Israel. Similarly, the anonymous senior defense official told reporters on October 9: \u201cWe are deeply concerned about Hezbollah making the wrong decision and choosing to open a second front to this conflict.\u201d The official did not point to the north as a special vulnerability.   The size of Iran\u2019s military   Trump claimed in an October speech in Florida: \u201cYou know, Iran\u2019s got close to a 3 million person army, military. That\u2019s big stuff. You know, that\u2019s no longer the minor leagues.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s \u201c3 million\u201d figure is false. \u201cIran\u2019s army is about a million strong, with 1/3 of that number comprised of reservists,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group think tank, said in an email. In 2019, the US government\u2019s Defense Intelligence Agency used similar numbers in a report on Iran\u2019s military power, estimating that Iran\u2019s military had a total of 1.06 million people, including 610,000 active personnel.   Singapore and drugs   Promoting his proposal to give the death penalty to drug dealers, Trump said in a November speech in New Hampshire, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you do it as Singapore does, the death penalty. They have no drugs whatsoever, no drugs whatsoever.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that Singapore has \u201cno drugs whatsoever\u201d is false. Singapore\u2019s Central Narcotics Bureau said in an official report on the local drug situation in 2022: \u201cMethamphetamine, heroin, and cannabis were the three most commonly abused drugs in 2022, with 95% of drug abusers arrested abusing at least one of these three drugs.\u201d The report also noted that the bureau had made seizures of heroin, methamphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and various other drugs, and it said that \u201cin Singapore, the rise of cannabis abuse is of major concern.\u201d   In the same speech, Trump claimed that China, which also executes some drug dealers, has \u201cno drug problem\u201d as a result. Joseph Amon, director of the Office of Global Health at the Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health, said in a November email: \u201cThere is no specific definition of what is a drug \u2018problem,\u2019 but both in both China and Singapore there are people who use illicit drugs and in both countries illicit drug use is seen as a significant concern requiring government resources in terms of policing, surveillance, prevention and treatment.\u201d   An Iraqi judge   In an October speech in Florida, Trump claimed that the Justice Department recently invited an Iraqi judge to visit Washington \u2013 and \u201cafter that, the foreign judge issued a warrant for my arrest for blowing up the number one terrorist in the world, Soleimani. So he came in, he was invited by this incompetent president. \u2018Please come in.\u2019 And he ended up issuing an arrest for my \u2013 he wanted to arrest me because I killed the number one terrorist in the world.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s narrative is thoroughly inaccurate. The judge, Faiq Zidan, head of Iraq\u2019s Supreme Judicial Council, did not issue a warrant for Trump\u2019s arrest over the Soleimani assassination \u201cafter\u201d he visited Washington \u2013 and, in fact, Zidan\u2019s spokesperson told Fox News in October that Zidan\u2019s planned visit to Washington had been postponed. What actually happened was that in early 2023, while marking the third anniversary of the assassination, Zidan gave public remarks in which he discussed how Trump was already wanted for the assassination (which took place in Iraq and also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the Iraqi deputy head of the Iran-backed Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces). An Iraqi court had issued an arrest warrant for Trump in 2021.   There is no indication that Biden himself had invited Zidan to Washington. (The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment about the matter.) Regardless, Trump\u2019s claim that Zidan visited Washington and then issued an arrest warrant isn\u2019t true.   A memo about migrants   Trump said in an October speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition: \u201cJust days ago, Customs and Border [Protection] \u2013 who are incredible people by the way \u2013 distributed a memo warning that Hamas, Hezbollah fighters and jihadists are infiltrating across our wide-open border.They\u2019re all over the place.\u201d   Facts First: Trump inaccurately described this memo, which was produced by the intelligence unit at the Customs and Border Protection office in San Diego. The memo, a \u201csituational awareness\u201d brief for employees that was obtained by right-wing media outlets, suggested that foreign fighters affiliated with Middle East militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah \u201cmay\u201d try to enter the US across the Mexican border.Contrary to Trump\u2019s claim, the memo did not say these fighters \u201care\u201d coming across the border or are \u201call over the place.\u201d   Customs and Border Protection headquarters in Washington subsequently issued an official statement to media outlets saying, \u201cCBP has seen no indication of Hamas-directed foreign fighters seeking to make entry into the United States.\u201d   The San Diego memo warned that people \u201cinspired by, or reacting to, the current Israel-Hamas conflict may attempt travel to or from the area of hostilities in the Middle East via circuitous transit across the Southwest border.\u201d The memo mentioned the possibility of attempted entry by \u201cforeign fighters motivated by ideology or mercenary soldiers of fortune.\u201d   Migration from China   Trump spoke in a November speech in Florida about young male migrants crossing the border into the US. He said, \u201cAnd they\u2019re coming from China \u2013 16% come from China.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s \u201c16%\u201d figure is inaccurate. Official data from US Customs and Border Protection shows that Chinese nationals were involved in about 1.6% of nationwide border encounters in the 2023 fiscal year, an increase from 1% in the 2022 fiscal year but nowhere near Trump\u2019s claim. At the southwest border in particular, Chinese nationals made up just under 1% of encounters in fiscal 2023 \u2013 a spike from fiscal 2022, when they made up less than 0.1% of encounters, but again far from what Trump said.   The federal data is not broken down by sex.   US and European aid to Ukraine   Trump said in an October speech in Iowa that although \u201ceverybody feels badly for Ukraine,\u201d he has a \u201cproblem with\u201d Europe\u2019s level of assistance to Ukraine compared to US assistance to Ukraine: \u201cSo if you look at it, Europe \u2013 so they\u2019re at $25 billion and we\u2019re $200 billion. Only a stupid person would make that deal.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s figures are grossly inaccurate. Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute for the World Economy, which tracks aid to Ukraine, found that, through July 31, the European Union was the largest contributor of aid to Ukraine since late January 2022 (including military, humanitarian and financial aid), at $85.1 billion in direct commitments, while the US was second at $76.8 billion \u2013 and the total for Europe is even higher if you add in contributions by individual EU member states directly and through EU institutions. For example, Germany had made $23.1 billion in its own commitments, per the Kiel Institute data, in addition to providing another $19.2 billion via EU institutions.   The US was the largest contributor of military aid in particular, at $46.6 billion in commitments compared to about $18.9 billion for Germany.   Trump\u2019s New York civil case   Criticizing the civil fraud trial against him in New York, Trump claimed in an October speech in Florida that \u201cit\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve ever used the statute\u201d and that \u201cthey used the statute that\u2019s never been used before.\u201d   Facts First: This is false. New York Executive Law 63(12), the 1956 statute that New York Attorney General Letitia James invoked in filing the lawsuit that led to the civil trial, has been used for decades by New York attorneys general against a wide range of entities, ranging from an e-cigarette company to school bus companies to oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (which won its case). In fact, it had also been used against Trump University and the Trump Foundation, generating millions in settlements.   The law gives the state attorney general broad powers against people thought to be engaged in alleged \u201crepeated fraudulent or illegal acts\u201d or who have otherwise shown \u201cpersistent fraud or illegality.\u201d Some experts have said that this James lawsuit against Trump over business fraud (as opposed to consumer fraud) is a novel use of the statute, but Trump\u2019s claim was that the statute had never been used before, period.   A lawyer at the Manhattan DA\u2019s office   In a November speech in New Hampshire, Trump claimed that Biden is behind the criminal case brought against him by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Trump also complained that Bragg\u2019s office had hired a former senior official in the federal Justice Department, Matthew Colangelo.   Speaking of Biden, Trump said, \u201cHe took his top person from the Department of Justice and put him into the local New York, Manhattan DA\u2019s office \u2013 running it. You\u2019re not even allowed to do that. But they took the top person, as you know; I believe the name is Colangelo. They took the top person and put him into the Manhattan DA\u2019s office.\u201d   Facts First: There is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s decision to join the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office in 2022 as senior counsel to Bragg. Regardless, Trump\u2019s claim that Bragg\u2019s hiring of Colangelo was \u201cnot even allowed\u201d is wrong. Colangelo was free to get a new job.   Colangelo and Bragg knew each other before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney. They worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general \u2013 where Colangelo investigated Trump\u2019s charity and Trump\u2019s financial practices and was involved in bringing various lawsuits against the Trump administration.   Colangelo served as acting associate attorney general in the first months of the Biden administration in early 2021 and then as principal deputy associate attorney general. As acting associate attorney general, he was third in command of the Justice Department.   Trump\u2019s federal gag order   Trump criticized the gag order imposed on him by US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over his federal election subversion case. Before Trump noted that the gag order was put on hold by an appeals court in early November (pending oral arguments later in November), he said in a November speech in New Hampshire: \u201cI mean, I have a judge in Washington DC who put a gag order on me \u2013 I cannot speak. So if the fake news asked me a question about, like, something, I cannot speak. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 How do you think that would be in a campaign?\u2026\u2018Uh what do you think about the campaign?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t comment.\u2019\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are false. Even before the gag order was put on hold, it\u2019s not true that the order meant Trump couldn\u2019t comment on the election campaign or that it meant he \u201ccannot speak\u201d in general. The gag order was limited, tailored to restrict speech the judge believed could jeopardize the integrity of the case. It clearly permitted Trump to opine on the campaign.   The order explicitly said that Trump was free to assert his innocence on the charges against him and to criticize the government, the Biden administration, the Justice Department, and the platforms and policies of his \u201ccurrent political rivals.\u201d   The order specifically prohibited all \u201cinterested parties\u201d in the case, which include Trump, from making statements (or directing others to make statements) targeting special counsel Jack Smith or his staff, court staff and supporting personnel, defense counsel or their staff, or \u201cany reasonably foreseeable witness or the substance of their testimony.\u201d   The Presidential Records Act   Trump, who has been charged with illegally retaining classified documents after his presidency, claimed in an October speech in Florida that, as a former president, \u201cI come under the Presidential Records Act\u201d and so \u201cI can do whatever I want.\u201d   Facts First: This is false. The Presidential Records Act does not say a president can do whatever they want with official documents. Rather, it says that all presidential records belong to the federal government the moment the president leaves office. By having official records at Mar-a-Lago after his presidency, Trump was in clear contravention of the law.   The key sentence from the Presidential Records Act is unequivocal: \u201cUpon the conclusion of a President\u2019s term of office, or if a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the last term, the Archivist of the United States shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.\u201d   Trump didn\u2019t mention it in the October speech, but he has previously claimed that a district court decision in a civil case related to former President Bill Clinton gave Trump the right to do whatever he wants with presidential records. That\u2019s not true.   Trump\u2019s New York civil trial   Trump claimed in a November speech in Florida that Biden is behind his civil fraud trial in New York: \u201cEven that stupid trial going on in New York which has been totally discredited \u2013 everybody\u2019s been discredited \u2013 that all comes out of the White House; that\u2019s to discourage people from voting.\u201d   Facts First: There is no basis for the claim that Biden or the Biden White House is behind the civil trial. The case was brought by New York state Attorney General Letitia James \u2013 after an investigation she began in 2019, roughly two years before Biden became president. As Trump has repeatedly noted, James, a Democrat, campaigned in 2018 on a pledge to pursue Trump. (Also, federal agencies do not have jurisdiction over state cases like this.)   James filed the lawsuit that led to this trial in September 2022 \u2013 about two months before Trump launched his 2024 campaign.   Al Capone\u2019s indictments   Trump repeatedly denounced the four criminal cases against him\u00a0 as unfounded and politically motivated \u2013 and, to underscore his point, he claimed in speech after speech that he has been indicted four times while the legendary gangster Al Capone only got indicted once.   For example, Trump said in an October speech in Florida: \u201cDid anybody ever hear of Al Capone? The greatest of all time, right. The greatest gangster of all time. If you look at him wrong, he\u2019d kill you, and he\u2019d kill you with his hands. He was a tough guy. He got indicted one time. I got indicted four times.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that Capone was indicted only one time is false. Capone was indicted at least six times, as A. Brad Schwartz, the co-author of a book on Capone, told CNN.   And that doesn\u2019t include various criminal charges against Capone that did not involve an indictment, such as some misdemeanors, or obscure Capone cases for which CNN couldn\u2019t immediately determine whether there was an indictment, which you can read more about here.   Capone was indicted three times in 1931 alone, the year he was famously convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to 11 years in federal prison. Schwartz, co-author of the book \u201cScarface and the Untouchable: Al Capone, Eliot Ness, and the Battle for Chicago,\u201d explained that these three indictments were: \u201cA secret indictment for tax evasion handed down in March 1931 (before the statute of limitations ran out for charges from the year 1924)\u201d; a larger indictment in June 1931, with more than 20 counts, for tax evasion in the period from 1925 to 1929; \u201cand a bootlegging conspiracy indictment, based on the work of Eliot Ness and his Untouchables, later that same month.\u201d   Before the landmark 1931 conviction, Capone was arrested, indicted and convicted in 1929 for carrying concealed weapons in Philadelphia. Schwartz also noted two lesser-known indictments of Capone that did not result in a conviction: a 1926 federal indictment for conspiracy to violate Prohibition laws and a 1933 county indictment for racketeering.   Trump faces 91 total counts over his two federal indictments and two local indictments in Georgia and New York. Schwartz said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a race, of course, but it may be worth noting that Capone is also way ahead in individual counts (the 1931 Prohibition indictment alone added up to five thousand conspiracy charges).\u201d   Biden\u2019s comments about terror threats   Trump claimed in an October speech in New Hampshire that Biden had \u201cproclaimed that the number-one terror threat was not ISIS or al Qaeda, but Trump supporters, MAGA supporters.\u201d   Facts First: This is false. Biden has never said that Trump supporters or supporters of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement are the country\u2019s number-one \u201cterror threat,\u201d though Biden has more generally described Trump and MAGA supporters as a threat to the country. When talking about terrorism in particular, Biden has repeatedly said that the \u201cgreatest\u201d or \u201cmost dangerous\u201d threat is \u201cWhite supremacy\u201d or \u201cdomestic terrorism rooted in White supremacy.\u201d   Biden notably said in a September 2022 speech that \u201cDonald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic\u201d and that \u201cMAGA forces\u2026fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country.\u201d But he didn\u2019t rank these \u201cMAGA forces\u201d as the country\u2019s \u201cnumber-one terror threat.\u201d Nor has he ever singled out Trump supporters when discussing the terror threat from White supremacists.   Biden\u2019s claims about his past   Mocking Biden\u2019s penchant for embellishing his biography, Trump said in an October speech in Florida, \u201cListen, the other day they were talking about truckers; he said he was a trucker. Then they were talking about airline pilots; he said he was an airline pilot. He said he was an airline pilot.\u201d When the audience laughed, he said, \u201cNo, no. He said he was an airline pilot.\u201d   Facts First: Trump made a false claim while mocking Biden for making false claims. Trump was right that Biden has inaccurately claimed to have driven a truck in the past \u2013 though Biden made such claims in 2021, not \u201cthe other day\u201d as far as we can tell \u2013 but Trump was wrong that Biden has falsely claimed to be an airline pilot. That simply never happened.   This wasn\u2019t a one-time slip by Trump; he made a similar claim in September.   What Biden said about ammunition   Trump claimed in a November speech in Florida: \u201cBiden said this a couple of months ago: \u2018We have no ammunition.\u2019\u201d Trump repeated moments later, \u201cBiden got up and he said, \u2018We have no ammunition.\u2019 Now, number one, we should never be put in that position. But assuming it\u2019s true, who the hell would say it?\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that Biden said \u201cwe have no ammunition\u201d is false. Biden told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria in a July interview that the US was \u201clow on\u201d a particular kind of munition needed by Ukraine in its war with Russia, 155 millimeter artillery shells. Biden did not say the US had none of even these shells, let alone say the US had no ammunition at all.   Inflation   Trump said in a November speech in Florida: \u201cWe are a nation that has the highest inflation in 50 years.\u201d   Facts First: This claim is wrong in two ways. First, even when the inflation rate hit its Biden-era peak of 9.1% in June 2022, that 9.1% rate was the highest since 1981 \u2013 between 40 and 41 years prior, not \u201c50 years\u201d or \u201cover 50 years\u201d as Trump has claimed. (He has a longstanding habit of exaggerating even figures that would be helpful for him if he cited them correctly.) Second, Trump\u2019s present-tense \u201chas\u201d is no longer accurate. Inflation has declined sharply since the June 2022 peak, and the most recent available rate at the time he spoke, for September 2023, was 3.7% \u2013 a rate that, the Biden presidency aside, was exceeded as recently as 2011, far less than 50 years ago. The rate fell to 3.2% in October.   Bacon and inflation   Decrying inflation under Biden, Trump claimed in three of his speeches \u2013 as he has before \u2013 that the price of bacon is now five times what it used to be, saying in an October speech in New Hampshire that the increase happened \u201cin the last year and a half.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that the price of bacon has quintupled in the Biden era is not close to true. The average price of sliced bacon actually declined about 1.7% over the year and a half preceding Trump\u2019s comments, going from $7.203 per pound in March 2022 to $7.083 per pound in September 2023 (the most recent available monthly data at the time he spoke). The price increased by about 21.5% since the $5.831 per pound price January 2021, the month Biden took office \u2013 a substantial hike, but still far from the 400% increase Trump keeps claiming.   Household income under Biden   In the same October speech in New Hampshire in which Trump claimed \u201creal family income increased over $6,000 a year\u201d during his presidency, he also said, \u201cThe typical family has lost over $7,400 in annual income with crooked Joe in the White House.\u201d   Facts First: This is false, too.   Biden-era data for real median household income is only available through 2022; the 2022 figure, $74,580, was down $2,080 from 2020. So where did Trump get the assertion that family incomes have declined by $74,000 under Biden? As PolitiFact noted, Trump\u2019s campaign has said he is referring to a January estimate from a right-wing think tank, the Heritage Foundation.   But that Heritage estimate is far out of date, especially because the inflation rate has declined sharply since then. And it is not a fair comparison to the federal figures Trump was citing for his own era, which are calculated in a much different way than the Heritage estimate.   Biden and taxes   In an October speech in Iowa, Trump said, purporting to describe Biden\u2019s position on taxes, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have you pay the highest taxes in the history.\u201d He said, \u201cI gave you the greatest tax cut in history and they want to double, triple everything.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims about Biden\u2019s tax policies are false. Biden is not proposing anything close to the highest taxes in history or to double or triple the tax rates that existed under Trump.   Howard Gleckman, senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, said in an email: \u201cI don\u2019t know what \u2018they want to double, triple everything\u2019 means. But if he\u2019s suggesting that Biden would \u2018double, triple\u2019 federal income taxes, he\u2019s just making up numbers. There is no evidence to support that claim.\u201d Gleckman said his organization\u2019s analysis of Biden\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal 2024, which included his most recent tax plan, found that the major tax provisions would \u201cwould raise taxes by an average of $2,290, or reduce taxable income by 2.3 percent.\u201d   That\u2019s nowhere close to a doubling or tripling \u2013 and it\u2019s important to note that Biden\u2019s proposals would not be a tax hike at all for many households. Gleckman said, \u201cNearly all this increase would be paid by the highest income households. We projected that the bottom 2 quintiles (those making about $60,000 or less) would pay less tax than under current law. Middle income households would pay about the same.\u201d   The US dollar   Trump repeatedly claimed in October speeches that \u201cour currency is crashing and will soon no longer be the world standard.\u201d   Facts First: We can\u2019t fact check Trump\u2019s prediction about what will happen \u201csoon,\u201d but his October claims that the US dollar was \u201ccrashing\u201d were not true. By various measures, which you can learn more about in this previous fact check, the dollar was significantly stronger against foreign currencies at the time he spoke than it was when he left office, though it had dropped from its late-2022 peak. For example, when Trump made the claim on October 23, the Fed\u2019s Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index was up about 11% since Trump\u2019s last full day in office in 2021.   The dollar did fall in early November, but it remained well above early-2021 levels.   Demand for houses   In a November speech in Florida, Trump lamented the increase in mortgage rates under Biden, then said, \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get the money anyway so what difference does it make. Nobody\u2019s buying houses anymore.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cnobody\u201d is buying houses anymore is false, a massive exaggeration. While sales of existing homes fell in September to the lowest level in 13 years, an October forecast from the National Association of Realtors projected that there would be a total of 4.15 million existing homes sold in 2023. That would be down 17.5% from 2022\u2019s level, but 4.15 million is certainly not nothing. In addition, sales of newly constructed homes are actually projected to increase 4.5% this year over last, to 670,000.   - CNN\u2019s Anna Bahney contributed to this item.   Nikki Haley on refugees from Gaza   Trump, speaking of fellow Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, said in an October speech in New Hampshire: \u201cBut she flip-flopped \u2013 last week, you saw that disaster \u2013 after proposing to flood America with refugees from Gaza. Oh, that sounds like a wonderful idea, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is wrong. Haley did not propose taking in a large number of refugees from Gaza. Trump was falsely portraying her October 15 response to a question from CNN anchor Jake Tapper that was not even about US refugee policy toward Gaza. As CNN explained in a previous fact check, Haley never said anywhere in her comments to Tapper that she wanted the US to take in refugees from Gaza.   Rather, the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations was asked by Tapper for her thoughts about DeSantis having said that while the people of Gaza are not all Hamas, \u201cthey are all antisemitic\u201d and \u201cnone of them\u201d believes Israel has the right to exist. Haley responded that many Gazans don\u2019t want to be ruled by Hamas, just as many Iranians oppose the regime that governs them, and the US should continue to distinguish between terrorists and civilians.   She did not say the US should take in any of these Gaza civilians as refugees. And in subsequent remarks, Haley has expressed firm opposition to the US accepting refugees from Gaza. She argued on Fox in October that \u201cHamas-sympathizing\u201d Middle Eastern countries should take in these refugees instead.   Covid-19 restrictions in Florida and other states   In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump criticized DeSantis for imposing restrictions on his state during the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump contrasted DeSantis\u2019 Florida with the Republican-run states of Tennessee, South Carolina and South Dakota, claiming those states\u2019 leaders \u201ckept them open.\u201d He made the same claim in a November speech in Florida.   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims that South Carolina and Tennessee were kept \u201copen\u201d during the pandemic is false. Early in the pandemic in 2020, the Republican governors of both of those states ordered non-essential businesses to close, ordered residents to limit their movements, ordered schools closed (in South Carolina) or demanded that school districts themselves close schools (in Tennessee), stopped public access to outdoor spaces such as beaches and state parks, and then imposed capacity limits on various businesses during a gradual reopening process. DeSantis imposed broadly similar policies in Florida at the beginning of the pandemic.   Trump\u2019s claim is at least somewhat more accurate with regard to South Dakota, which did not impose statewide restrictions on individual movement or business operations. Gov. Kristi Noem did, however, impose or recommend some limitations, which you can read more about here.   DeSantis and ideological screening of immigrants   In an October speech in New Hampshire, Trump said this about DeSantis: \u201cAnd the campaign rapidly opposed my call for tough ideological screening on all foreign nationals. He was totally against it. Two days later, Ron [DeSantis] flip-flopped and plagiarized my entire plan.\u201d   Facts First: It\u2019s not true that DeSantis flip-flopped on the issue of \u201cideological screening\u201d of immigrants or that he plagiarized Trump\u2019s proposal for such screening. He has not expressed support for Trump\u2019s proposal.   It\u2019s true that the DeSantis campaign opposed Trump\u2019s screening idea. DeSantis campaign official Christina Pushaw criticized the idea on social media on October 17, writing a terrorist could simply lie about their beliefs and that an ideological screening program would likely end up being used by the federal government against conservatives. But DeSantis has not flip-flopped in favor of the idea.   Repeating his call to refuse entry to any refugees from Gaza, DeSantis said on Fox on November 14 that he favors completely prohibiting entry of people from societies with \u201ctoxic cultures\u201d rather than trying to undertake the \u201cdifficult\u201d task of using screening to divide individuals from such places into good and bad. \u201cI think you just say, \u2018You know what, we\u2019re not going to do it,\u2019\u201d he said.   Trump\u2019s endorsement of DeSantis   In a November speech in Texas, Trump told a version of a story he has told before about why he endorsed DeSantis\u2019 campaign for governor of Florida during a Republican primary in 2018. He said, \u201cRon was one of about 150 that were out there all the time saying the impeachment hoax number one, impeachment hoax number two \u2013 that they\u2019re hoaxes, right? And I appreciated that. So I said, \u2018Alright, look, we\u2019ll do it. It\u2019s going to be tough, but we\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s story about endorsing DeSantis because of his stance on a Trump \u201cimpeachment hoax\u201d cannot possibly be true. Trump issued his official endorsement of DeSantis in June 2018 \u2013 but his first impeachment battle, over his efforts to use the power of the presidency to pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden, did not begin until the fall of 2019. Trump might have been thinking of how DeSantis, then a member of the House, defended him over a special counsel investigation in 2017 into his campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia, which he has also called a \u201choax,\u201d but that probe did not lead to impeachment.   Obama\u2019s comments about manufacturing   In a November speech in Texas, at an engineering company specializing in offshore drilling, Trump reprised his old misstatement about Barack Obama\u2019s comments about the future of American manufacturing.   After his false claim to have created 1.2 million manufacturing jobs, Trump said, \u201cEverybody said that was impossible. Obama said it was not possible. He thought we gave up on manufacturing, that places like this\u2026wouldn\u2019t exist. You know that. He said that they\u2019ll be made in other places, you know, we would have nothing to do. What are we going to do?\u201d   Facts First: This is false. Obama did not think the US \u201cgave up on manufacturing,\u201d that products would simply be \u201cmade in other places\u201d or that \u201cwe would have nothing to do.\u201d As Trump did during his presidency, he appeared to be misstating a comment Obama made at a PBS town hall in 2016.   At that event, Obama scoffed at Trump\u2019s campaign promises to bring back what Obama called \u201cjobs of the past\u201d without providing specifics on how he would do so. Contrary to Trump\u2019s repeated claims, though, Obama didn\u2019t say US manufacturing was dead or that new US manufacturing jobs could not be created. In fact, Obama boasted of how many US manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, \u201cWe actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we\u2019ve had in most of our history.\u201d   Infanticide   Talking about abortion during an October speech in Iowa, Trump said that \u201cthe Democrats are the radicals because they\u2019ll kill a baby in four months, five months, six months, seven months, eight months, nine months \u2013 and even after birth. They\u2019re allowed to kill, in some cases, after birth.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cthey\u2019re allowed to kill, in some cases, after birth\u201d is false. That is infanticide, illegal in all 50 states.   There are some cases in which parents decide to choose palliative care for babies who are born with deadly conditions that give them just minutes, hours or days to live. That is simply not the same as killing a baby.   It\u2019s also worth noting that a tiny percentage of abortions are performed at 24 weeks of pregnancy or later. According to data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 0.9% of reported abortions in 2020 occurred at 21 weeks or later. (Some of these abortions occur because of serious health risks or lethal fetal anomalies.) By contrast, 80.9% of reported abortions in 2020 were conducted before 10 weeks, 93.1% before 14 weeks and 95.8% before 16 weeks.   A comment by Maxine Waters   In a November speech in Florida, Trump criticized the rhetoric of two Democratic members of Congress, Rep. Maxine Waters of California and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Then, moments later, he made reference to comments Waters made in 2018. Trump said, \u201cLook at some of the things that they say. They want you to walk into that restaurant and knock the hell out of them, they said. Right?\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s description of Waters\u2019 remark is false. Waters made a controversial comment in 2018 urging citizens to confront and harass members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet in public places like restaurants, but she never said anyone should \u201cknock the hell out of them.\u201d   Amid a controversy over the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the southern border, Waters said at a 2018 rally: \u201cLet\u2019s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they\u2019re not welcome anymore, anywhere. We\u2019ve got to get the children connected to their parents.\u201d   Waters\u2019 remark was criticized by numerous Republicans and by some Democrats, but Trump has long exaggerated what she said. After he claimed in 2018 that Waters had called for \u201charm\u201d to supporters of his political movement, CNN reported that \u201cWaters, however, did not call for physical harm to the officials or harassment against Trump\u2019s supporters.\u201d   Pelosi and the attack on the Capitol   In an October speech in Florida, Trump again tried to cast blame on Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, over the attack on the US Capitol by a pro-Trump mob on January 6, 2021. Trump said: \u201cShe\u2019s a bad woman\u2026And she was responsible for security at the Capitol, just so you [know] \u2013 we offered her 10,000 soldiers. She was responsible for the security of the Capitol. And she failed.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is wrong in more than one way.   First, the speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security. Capitol security is overseen by the Capitol Police Board, a body that includes the sergeants at arms of the House and the Senate.   Second, Pelosi\u2019s office has explicitly said she was not even presented with an offer of 10,000 troops, telling CNN last year claims to the contrary are \u201clies.\u201d And even if Pelosi had been told of an offer of National Guard troops, she would not have had the power to turn it down. The speaker of the House has no authority to prevent the deployment of the District of Columbia National Guard, which reports to the president (whose authority was delegated, under a decades-old executive order, to the Secretary of the Army).   Fourth, it\u2019s worth noting the House select committee that investigated the attack on the Capitol found \u201cno evidence\u201d Trump gave any actual order for 10,000 Guard troops, and the Biden-era Pentagon told The Washington Post in 2021 it has no record of any such order. Christopher Miller, Trump\u2019s acting defense secretary at the time, testified to the House select committee that investigated the attack on the Capitol that Trump had, in a January 5 phone call, briefly and informally floated the idea of having 10,000 troops present on January 6 but did not issue any directive to that effect. Miller said, \u201cI interpreted it as a bit of presidential banter or President Trump banter that you all are familiar with, and in no way, shape, or form did I interpret that as an order or direction.\u201d   The cost of an aircraft carrier   In a November speech in Texas, Trump complained about the cost and design features of a new US Navy aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, which was deployed to the eastern Mediterranean Sea in October after the Hamas attack on Israel. He claimed \u201cit was $10 billion over budget,\u201d repeating a bit later, \u201cThe ship is $10 billion over budget\u2026it was supposed to cost $3 billion or less, and I think it ended up at $18 billion for one ship. One ship that\u2019s improperly designed.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s numbers were way off. While the ship did cost much more than the original cost cap set by Congress, that original cap was $10.5 billion, not \u201c$3 billion or less.\u201d The approximate actual cost of the ship was about $13.3 billion, not \u201c$18 billion.\u201d In other words, it was roughly $3 billion over budget, not \u201c$10 billion over budget.\u201d   The actual final total cost of the ship might be even higher than the reported $13.3 billion because that number didn\u2019t include the cost of fixing some final issues with the ship. But there\u2019s no basis for Trump\u2019s claim that the final cost has ended at $18 billion.   Homicides in Washington, DC   Describing Washington, DC as \u201ca nightmare of murder and crime,\u201d Trump said in a November speech in Iowa: \u201cLast night, three people were killed.\u201d   Facts First: This is false. Washington recorded one homicide on the day before this Trump speech, Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson Lee Lepe told CNN.   Trump could have fairly noted that homicide and violent crime have spiked in Washington, DC this year. But the capital averages fewer than one homicide per day, so Trump\u2019s inaccurate claim served to exaggerate the situation.   Migrants and the courts   In an\u00a0October speech in New Hampshire, Trump claimed that only a tiny percentage of migrants show up for their immigration court hearings.   \u201cOnly the really dumb ones show up. You know, nobody shows up,\u201d Trump said. He added, \u201cOnly about 1% come back, and they\u2019re the ones that you really don\u2019t want, because they\u2019re not very smart.\u201d   Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims that \u201cnobody shows up\u201d and \u201conly about 1% come back\u201d are false and\u00a0not even close to correct. Official federal figures show that the vast majority of people attend their immigration court hearings. \u201cThe statistics that are available reflect high levels of attendance,\u201d said Michelle Mittelstadt, communications director for the Migration Policy Institute think tank.   As Mittelstadt noted, the Justice Department publishes\u00a0data\u00a0on the percentage of removal orders that are issued by the immigration courts \u201cin absentia,\u201d without the person present. The numbers prove that Trump\u2019s claims are inaccurate: the \u201cin absentia\u201d rate was about 36% from the 2014 fiscal year through the 2022 fiscal year. In other words, by this key measure, just under two-thirds of people attended their hearings. And in the Biden era, attendance has been better than the recent average: the \u201cin absentia\u201d rate was 10% in fiscal 2021, 22% in fiscal 2022 and 34% in the portion of fiscal 2023 for which data was available.   \u201cEmpirical data show that a majority of respondents appear for their removal proceedings and suggest that failure to appear for court is associated with factors like access to counsel,\u201d Congress\u2019 nonpartisan Congressional Research Service\u00a0wrote in a 2022 report.   For a variety of reasons, actual attendance at immigration proceedings might be even higher than \u201cin absentia\u201d figures suggest. A\u00a02021 study by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration organization, found that \u201c83% of nondetained immigrants with completed or pending removal cases attended all their hearings from 2008 to 2018.\u201d   The population of New York state   In a November speech in Florida, Trump predicted that the number of people crossing the border without authorization under Biden would end up being more than 15 million, then said, \u201cWhich is larger than New York state.\u201d He repeated that claim in a November speech in Texas near the Mexican border, saying \u201cI believe by the end of this administration it\u2019ll be 15 million people \u2013 that\u2019s bigger than New\u00a0 York state \u2013 will have come into our country illegally.\u201d   Facts First: Regardless of the merits of Trump\u2019s \u201c15 million\u201d prediction, 15 million is not \u201cbigger than New York state.\u201d New York had a population of about 19.7 million in July 2022, the Census Bureau estimated.   A Trump crowd vs. a Hillary Clinton crowd   Trump, who has long exaggerated about crowd sizes, reprised a claim he has made in the past about the 2016 election campaign. He said in an October speech in Florida that he had \u201c38,000 people\u201d at a speech in Michigan the day before the election while Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton \u201chad like almost nobody\u201d and \u201chad like 100 people.\u201d   Facts First: Each of these Trump claims is false. First, there were not 38,000 people at his election-eve speech in Michigan. Second, there was a full-house crowd of 4,600 people at Clinton\u2019s Michigan speech that day, The Detroit News reported in 2016 \u2013 not \u201clike 100 people.\u201d   Trump\u2019s exact crowd size that day is not known, but it was always clear that it was not 30,000-plus. After Trump claimed in 2017 that the crowd had 32,000 people, Nick LaFave, who was a television news anchor in Grand Rapids, where the rally took place, wrote on Twitter: \u201cI covered that rally. The place was definitely beyond capacity. I think we estimated 8k. Many more outside who never got in. But, no way that got to 32k. None. No way.\u201d   Trump\u2019s rally crowds in Alabama   Boasting of the \u201cmassive crowds\u201d at his rallies, Trump claimed in an October speech in Florida: \u201cAlabama \u2013 we had 68,000\u2026we had 68,000 people.\u201d   Facts First: Trump has not had 68,000 people at any of his Alabama rallies, though he has drawn big crowds in the state.   Trump has exaggerated for years about how many people attended his rally in Mobile, Alabama in August 2015, sometimes putting the crowd at \u201c49,000.\u201d Mobile city officials estimated the crowd at 30,000; the event was held in a 43,000-seat football stadium that looked \u201cless than half full,\u201d Politico reported at the time. And local law enforcement officials offered an estimate of 45,000 people at a 2021 Trump rally in Alabama, citing the Secret Service, AL.com reported at the time.   Trump\u2019s rally crowds in Texas   Boasting in the same Florida speech about the size of his rally crowds, Trump said, \u201cTexas: we had 104,000 people.\u201d   Facts First: Trump has not had a six-figure crowd at any of his Texas events. His campaign claimed in 2018 that 100,000 people had requested tickets to a rally in Houston, but ticket requesters are not actual attendees. Houston\u2019s police chief said in 2018 that 18,000 to 19,000 people were inside the arena where Trump spoke and that another approximately 3,000 people gathered outside the arena.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

During\u00a0the course of\u00a0Futurism\u2019s\u00a0reporting,\u00a0some\u00a0of the alleged\u00a0Sports Illustrated\u00a0writers mysteriously vanished from the\u00a0publication\u2019s\u00a0website \u2014 and their\u00a0articles\u00a0began appearing under the names of different authors who similarly didn\u2019t\u00a0appear to\u00a0exist online and whose likenesses were also being sold on AI headshot marketplaces.   Following the publication of the report, a spokesperson for The Arena Group \u2014 which has operated and licensed Sports Illustrated since 2019 \u2014 told CNN that the\u00a0deleted\u00a0product review\u00a0articles\u00a0had been created by\u00a0a third-party company, AdVon Commerce.   \u201cWe have learned that AdVon had writers use a pen or pseudo name in certain articles to protect author privacy \u2014 actions we don\u2019t condone \u2014 and we are removing the content while our internal investigation continues and have since ended the partnership,\u201d the spokesperson said.   Writers, editors, and researchers at AdVon create content following a policy that makes use of both counter-plagiarism and counter-AI software, the Arena Group spokesperson said.   \u201cWe continually monitor our partners and were in the midst of a review when these allegations were raised,\u201d the spokesperson told CNN. \u201cAdVon has assured us that all of the articles in question were written and edited by humans.\u201d   AdVon did not respond to a CNN request for comment. But the questions raised Monday marked the second time in as many months that AdVon has found itself at the center of an AI\u00a0publishing\u00a0controversy.   In October, Gannett-owned Reviewed came under fire following reports it had used AI to produce stories. A similar investigation followed: The website contained several stories written by\u00a0authors\u00a0who couldn\u2019t be found online and whose colleagues couldn\u2019t confirm their existence.\u00a0But Gannett denied the articles had been written with the use of AI.   Following Futurism\u2019s\u00a0report\u00a0Monday, the Sports Illustrated Union, which represents staff writers for the magazine, said that its members were\u00a0\u201chorrified\u201d\u00a0by the\u00a0allegations.   \u201cIf true, these practices violate everything we believe in about journalism,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cWe deplore being associated with something so disrespectful to our readers.\u201d   Sports Illustrated writers also reacted with disgust\u00a0in social media posts.   \u201cAlong with basic principles of honesty, trust, journalistic ethics, etc. \u2014 I take seriously the weight of a Sports Illustrated byline,\u201d Emma Baccellieri, a staff writer for the magazine,\u00a0posted\u00a0to X. \u201cIt meant something to me long before I ever dreamed of working here. This report was horrifying to read.\u201d   \u201cThe practices described in the story published today do real damage to the credibility of the hardworking humans I have been honored to work with for the past 9 years,\u201d\u00a0added\u00a0Mitch Goldich, another writer and editor at the magazine,\u00a0posted\u00a0on X.   The Arena Group is\u00a0not the first\u00a0publishing company\u00a0to be\u00a0ensnared\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0rapid deployment\u00a0of AI. Since\u00a0the technology\u2019s\u00a0explosion on the commercial scene\u00a0nearly\u00a0one year ago, several news organizations have begun deploying AI to partially automate and expedite the publication of certain kinds of stories, with mixed results. For instance, the\u00a0Online News Association\u00a0has published a practical guide for newsrooms to navigate the technology.   Still, news organizations are typically wary of producing entire stories using AI, as\u00a0Gannett\u00a0learned\u00a0this summer\u00a0during an experiment with\u00a0the technology\u00a0in which the platform produced several botched high school sports articles.

CNN Sans \u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network.", "Mike Johnson\u2019s America: Revisit landmark SCOTUS decisions and use government to \u2018restrain evil\u2019 | CNN Politics": " Mike Johnson, the new speaker of the House, voiced support for revisiting Supreme Court decisions that struck down restrictions on the use of contraception, barred bans on gay sex and legalized same sex marriages, according to a CNN review of his prior public statements.   On a conservative talk radio show the day the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Johnson underscored Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s concurring opinion that the high court should reconsider those other landmark rulings.   Johnson,\u00a0citing his years as an attorney against \u201cactivist courts,\u201d defended Thomas\u2019 view, insisting that what Thomas was calling for was, \u201cnot radical. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite of that.\u201d   \u201cThere\u2019s been some really bad law made,\u201d he\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019ve made a mess of our jurisprudence in this country for the last several decades. And maybe some of that needs to be cleaned up.\u201d   When asked about Johnson\u2019s post-Roe comments, a spokesman for the congressman told CNN that Johnson \u201cviews the cases as settled law.\u201d   Still, CNN\u2019s review of more than 100 of Johnson\u2019s\u00a0interviews, speeches and public commentary spanning\u00a0his decades-long career as a lawmaker and attorney paints a picture of his governing ideals: Imprisoning doctors\u00a0who perform\u00a0abortions after six weeks; the Ten Commandments\u00a0prominently displayed\u00a0in public buildings; an elimination of anti-hate-crime\u00a0laws;\u00a0Bible study\u00a0in public schools.   From\u00a0endorsing\u00a0hard labor prison sentences for abortion providers to supporting the\u00a0criminalization\u00a0of gay sex, his staunchly conservative\u00a0rhetoric is rooted in an era\u00a0of \u201cbiblical\u00a0morality,\u201d that\u00a0he says\u00a0was washed away with the counterculture in the 1960s.    House Speaker Johnson meets with Trump at Mar-a-Lago   \u201cOne of the primary purposes of the law in civil government is to restrain evil,\u201d Johnson said on one\u00a0radio show in 2010. \u201cWe have to acknowledge collectively that man is inherently evil and needs to be restrained.\u201d   His vision has been well received as a congressman in his deeply conservative district in western Louisiana. But his surprising rise to the speakership has brought his particularly subtle brand of fire-and-brimstone to second in line to the presidency \u2014 delivering him a national platform from which to shape and influence laws.   Johnson\u2019s endorsement of Thomas\u2019 opinion, legal experts say, positioned him significantly outside the mainstream.   \u201cSpeaker Johnson embraces a view that is not only outside of the mainstream but is so radical in terms of his endorsement of the Thomas position, that even the extremely conservative Supreme Court majority isn\u2019t willing to go there,\u201d said Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a CNN legal analyst. \u201cIt would take the country back more than a half-century.\u201d   CNN unearthed more than two dozen radio interviews from Johnson\u2019s time as an attorney at the socially conservative legal advocacy group Alliance Defense Fund (ADF) where Johnson litigated and voiced support for what he sometimes described as a battle for the country between the forces of good and evil.   \u201cThe arrows in the culture war are particularly directed at our youth, where the Enemy often has the greatest effect,\u201d read the\u202f2005\u202f\u00a0webpage\u00a0for \u201cGod & Country,\u201d a Christian local radio show co-hosted by Johnson. \u201cWe cannot lose our children to the forces of darkness. Be aware and get active in your kids\u2019 schools.\u201d   Topics discussed\u00a0on the show\u00a0included \u201ccreation science\u201d in public schools; how to \u201cfight the porn industry\u201d; God\u2019s \u201cdesign for government\u201d; and \u201cthe true meaning of \u2018separation of church and state.\u2019\u201d   As an attorney at ADF, Johnson repeatedly battled two organizations in his fight to keep religion in the public square: The American Civil Liberties Union, which he\u00a0called\u00a0\u201cthe most dangerous organization in America,\u201d and Americans United for Separation of Church and State. The groups clashed over prayer in public schools, public displays of nativity scenes and the right to open public meetings with prayer.   \u201cThey have convinced an entire generation of Americans that there\u2019s this so-called separation of church and state,\u201d\u00a0Johnson said in 2008 about the ACLU.   Johnson\u2019s rhetoric has tapped into a \u201cpersecution complex\u201d for evangelicals as American culture leans increasingly left on social issues, said Ryan Burge, a political scientist at Eastern Illinois University and a Baptist pastor.   \u201cThey want to feel embattled. They want to fight the culture war,\u201d Burge told CNN.   \u201cWhen he talks about Griswold and Lawrence, evangelicals know that what he really is saying to them is: \u2018Our way of life is under attack and liberalism is on the march. Stand firm in our convictions,\u2019\u201d added Burge, referring to the landmark cases that legalized gay sex and contraception use.   Johnson served not only as an attorney at ADF but a national spokesman for the organization, making appearances on radio and national television where he often\u00a0addressed\u00a0so-called \u201cright of conscience\u201d cases involving Christian businesses.   Discussing\u00a0one case\u00a0in New Mexico, where a wedding photography company was found in violation of the state\u2019s anti-discrimination laws for refusing to photograph a same-sex couple\u2019s commitment ceremony, Johnson argued anti-discrimination laws did not recognize a \u201cbehavior\u201d like homosexuality.   \u201cThere are laws on the books that prohibit discrimination against people for their immutable characteristics, their race and creed and that kind of thing,\u201d\u00a0Johnson said\u00a0in a 2009 radio interview. \u201cThere\u2019s\u00a0a difference \u2013 and the law has recognized a difference \u2013 between that and homosexual behavior. As something that you do, not an immutable characteristic of what you are.\u201d   The New Mexico Supreme Court disagreed and ruled against the company, which ADF represented.\u00a0The Supreme Court\u00a0declined\u00a0to hear the case.   Johnson \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand the problem with a government compelling its citizens to follow not just religion, but a particular religion,\u201d said\u202fKatherine Lewis Parker,\u202fthe former\u202flegal director for the ACLU of North Carolina, who opposed Johnson in a lawsuit related to prayer at official meetings.   In that\u00a02007 suit, three residents\u00a0in Forsyth County, North Carolina, argued\u202flocal officials had an unconstitutional \u201cpractice of sponsoring sectarian prayer\u201d with specific references to Jesus during meetings.\u202fJohnson defended the officials and argued that even in Congress, prayers often contain Christian references, which he called a \u201clogical function of the nation\u2019s demographics.\u201d   During a deposition, Johnson peppered one of the plaintiffs\u202fabout what type of prayer would be acceptable in county meetings.\u202f\u201cSo if someone might be offended by virtually any prayer, should we just get rid of prayer entirely?\u201d he asked.   I think he is a true believer and I think he wants to blend religion and government.   Kathleen Lewis Parker, former legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina   An appeals court ruled against\u00a0Johnson\u2019s arguments in 2011, though\u00a0the Supreme Court later\u202fruled\u202fin favor of allowing such prayers in a separate case.   \u201cI think he is a true believer and I think he wants to blend religion and government,\u201d\u202fParker said of Johnson.   Homosexuality was a\u00a0frequent topic\u00a0for Johnson, which he has called \u201cinherently unnatural\u201d and a \u201cdangerous lifestyle.\u201d In\u00a0addition to suggesting\u00a0he hopes\u00a0the Supreme Court will reverse its decision allowing same-sex marriage, he also\u00a0wrote in support of Texas\u2019 anti-sodomy laws, which said gay men caught having sex could be fined.   \u201cIt recognized a fundamental right, a constitutional right to, to sodomy, which had never been recognized before,\u201d Johnson\u00a0said at a forum in\u00a02005\u00a0on\u00a0the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Lawrence v. Texas \u2014 which struck down the ban on gay sex in that state.   Johnson supported an Arkansas\u00a0law\u00a0against same-sex couples adopting\u00a0children, citing\u00a0it as\u00a0\u201cgood public policy\u201d in 2008. In 2013, he opposed President Barack Obama\u2019s appointment of an \u201copenly homosexual\u201d\u00a0ambassador, Wally Brewster,\u00a0to\u00a0the Dominican Republic, calling\u00a0it a\u00a0provocative move against the Catholic country.   In 2015, transitioning from his role at ADF to a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, Johnson sparked national controversy with the \u201cMarriage and Conscience Act.\u201d\u00a0The bill\u00a0aimed to protect individuals objecting to same-sex marriage on religious grounds but faced\u00a0opposition\u00a0from Johnson\u2019s hometown\u00a0editorial board,\u00a0business\u00a0leaders\u00a0and even Republicans\u00a0in the state legislature.   Critics\u00a0argued it could enable discrimination against LGBTQ individuals by businesses. Following backlash, the bill never reached a vote. In response to the bill\u2019s failure, then-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, issued a similar executive order.   \u201cApparently, defending religious liberty makes one \u2018anti-gay\u2019 now,\u201d\u00a0Johnson wrote\u00a0on Facebook amid debate on the bill.   Just two years later, Johnson moved from the state legislature to Congress where he\u2019s\u00a0maintained\u00a0a 92% rating from the CPAC Center for Legislative Accountability \u2013 11% higher\u00a0than\u00a0the average Republican in 2022.   In Congress, Johnson signed on to some of the toughest anti-abortion bills,\u00a0such as\u00a0a 2021 so-called \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d which would essentially outlaw abortion after six\u00a0weeks. He has repeatedly\u00a0called states\u00a0that allow abortion \u201cpro-death\u201d states.   \u201cIt is truly an American holocaust,\u201d\u00a0Johnson said\u00a0in May\u00a02022\u00a0on local DC radio. \u201cThe reality is that Planned Parenthood and all these\u00a0big abortion (providers), they set up their\u00a0clinics in inner cities. They regard these people as easy prey. I mean, it\u2019s true.\u201d   Johnson also\u00a0supported\u00a0plans\u00a0to\u00a0change\u00a0Medicare and Social Security benefits while increasing the retirement age,\u00a0emphasizing urgency\u00a0in addressing\u00a0escalating entitlement.   He has blamed booming entitlements costs in part on abortion.   \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have 40 or 50 million able-bodied workers in the economy,\u201d Johnson\u00a0said\u00a0on a\u00a0podcast he co-hosts\u00a0with\u00a0his wife. \u201cThat would be paying taxes into the system to be able to support their elderly, you know, neighbors and friends.\u201d   On numerous occasions, Johnson also voiced approval for a Louisiana state trigger law \u2013 passed in 2006 \u2013 which banned abortion without exceptions for rape and incest the day Roe v. Wade was overturned.   \u201cI\u2019m grateful to be from Louisiana, one of the dozen states or so that has a trigger law that will automatically become an abortion free state, pro-life,\u201d\u00a0Johnson said in\u00a02022.   In 2022, Johnson\u00a0introduced\u00a0a bill that some described as a national version of what critics call\u00a0Florida\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill. The bill\u00a0never made\u00a0it out of committee.   For Johnson and those who share his worldview, such policies have spiritual implications not only for individuals but the entire nation, said Philip Gorski, a professor and chair of the sociology department at Yale University who has studied Christian nationalism.   \u201cThere is much more at stake for Johnson and others who crome from that\u00a0conservative Christian subculture,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is this view the United States is a Christian nation which has entered into a sacred covenant with God that involves upholding certain standards of Christian morality, and when those standards are violated, when those precepts are broken, it threatens the entire country with divine wrath and all kinds of decline.\u201d   Following Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection defeat, Johnson played a pivotal role in efforts to overturn the election \u2013\u00a0urging his colleagues\u00a0to sign onto the Texas Attorney General\u2019s longshot lawsuit aiming to throw out the results in key swing states.   \u201cIt was rejected by a bipartisan majority of the Supreme\u00a0Court,\u201d Eisen told CNN, but Johnson was willing\u00a0to\u00a0 \u201cperpetuate the loser as the winner and to twist the law and the facts to support that.\u201d   Johnson also endorsed some fringe\u00a0conspiracies, including the unsubstantiated belief\u00a0that voting\u00a0software machines were manipulated.   On January 6, 2021, Johnson voted to\u00a0object the election results, later saying\u00a0he was\u00a0doing his \u201cduty to uphold the Constitution.\u201d   For Johnson, the vote to keep Trump in office reflected a striking evolution from his past critique of Trump in 2015,\u00a0whom, as first reported by the New York Times, he openly labeled as \u201cdangerous,\u201d lacking \u201ccharacter,\u201d and devoid of a \u201cmoral center.\u201d It was the apex of the transactional relationship between the religious right and former TV star.   During\u00a0a church\u00a0service in 2022, reflecting\u00a0on the conclusion of Roe v. Wade, Johnson remarked that much of the credit belonged to Trump.   \u201cThere is a lot of credit to go around, but you have to acknowledge, Donald Trump for all of his, peccadillos, okay?\u00a0Bless him,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe was true to his word.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Then Elon Musk got involved | CNN Business": "Markets    Hot Stocks    Fear & Greed Index     Latest Market News     Hot Stocks     Ben Brody says his life was going fine. He had just finished college, stayed out of trouble, and was prepping for law school. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Elon Musk used his considerable social media clout to amplify an online mob\u2019s misguided rants accusing the 22-year-old from California of being an undercover agent in a neo-Nazi group.   The claim, Brody told CNN, was as bizarre as it was baseless.   But the fact he bore a vague resemblance to a person allegedly in the group, that he was Jewish, and, that he once stated in a college fraternity profile posted online that he aspired to one day work for the government, was more than enough information for internet trolls to falsely conclude Brody was an undercover government agent (a \u201cFed\u201d) planted inside the neo-Nazi group to make them look bad.   For Brody, the fallout was immediate. Overnight, he became a central character in a story spun by people seeking to deny and downplay the actions of hate groups in the United States today.   The lies and taunts, which Musk engaged with on social media, turned his life upside down, Brody said. At one point, he said, he and his mother had to flee their home for fear of being attacked.   Now, he\u2019s fighting back.   Brody filed a defamation lawsuit last month against Musk, the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter. The suit seeks damages in excess of $1 million. Brody says he wants the billionaire to apologize and retract the false claims about him.   Brody\u2019s lawyer\u2014who is the same attorney who successfully sued conspiracy theorist Alex Jones over his lies about the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre \u2014said he hopes the suit will force one of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful men to reckon with his careless and harmful online behavior.   \u201cThis case strikes at the heart of something that I think is going really wrong in this country,\u201d attorney Mark Bankston said in an interview with CNN. \u201cHow powerful people, very influential people, are being far too reckless about the things they say about private people, people just trying to go about their lives who\u2019ve done nothing to cause this attention.\u201d    Elon Musk's X is testing an annual fee for unverified accounts   Asked for comment on the lawsuit, an attorney for Musk told CNN \u201cwe expect this case to be dismissed.\u201d Musk\u2019s lawyers have until Jan 5, 2024, to file their response in court.   On the night of Saturday, June 24, 2023, Ben Brody was in Riverside, California.   About 1,000 miles away, a gay pride event was being held near Portland, Oregon. In recent years, the city has become a flashpoint for often violent clashes over the country\u2019s ongoing culture wars.   It was no great surprise then that the event became a target for rival far-right groups and neo-Nazis who began fighting among themselves while protesting. Video of the skirmish, where the far-right protesters pushed and pulled at each other, quickly spread across social media.   Online conspiracy theorists soon jumped into the fray.   Rather than accept the fact that two far-right groups who have previously embraced violence were responsible for the clash, online trolls insisted it must be a so-called \u201cfalse flag\u201d event \u2013 a set-up of some kind to make the neo-Nazis look bad.   That\u2019s when they found Ben Brody.   The day after the Pride event, Brody began getting text messages from his friends telling him to check out social media.   \u201cYou\u2019re being accused of being a neo-Nazi fed,\u201d he recalled some of his friends telling him.   Somehow, someone on social media had found a photo of Brody online and decided he looked like one of the people involved in the clash.   Anonymous people online, self-appointed internet detectives, began digging and found out Brody was Jewish and had been a political science major at the University of California, Riverside. On his college fraternity\u2019s webpage, he had once stated he wanted to work for the government.   \u201cI put that I wanted to work for the government. And that\u2019s just because I didn\u2019t know specifically what part of the government I wanted to work for. You know, I was like, I could be a lawyer,\u201d Brody recalled in an interview with CNN.   His being Jewish was relevant to them because conspiracy theories are often steeped in antisemitism \u2013 suggesting there\u2019s a Jewish plan to control the world.   Brody\u2019s social media inboxes filled up with messages, such as \u201cFed,\u201d \u201cNazi,\u201d and \u201cWe got you.\u201d He and his mom were forced to leave their family home after their address was posted online, he said.   Some of Brody\u2019s friends began posting online, trying to correct the record and explain this was a case of mistaken identity. Brody himself posted a video to Instagram where he desperately tried to prove his innocence. He even went as far as getting time-stamped video surveillance footage showing him in a restaurant in Riverside, California, at the time of the brawl in Oregon, as proof he could not have been at the rally.   But to no avail. The conspiracy theory kept spreading across the internet, including on  X. But it wasn\u2019t just anonymous trolls fueling the lie. Musk, the platform\u2019s owner, had joined in, amplifying the lie to his millions of followers.   Video from the Oregon event showed the masks of at least one protester being removed during the fight between the opposing far-right groups. Musk asked on X on June 25, \u201cWho were the unmasked individuals?\u201d   Another X user linked to a tweet alleging Brody was one of the unmasked individuals. The tweet highlighted a line from Brody\u2019s fraternity profile that noted he wanted to work for the government after graduation.   The tweet claimed the unmasked alleged member of the far-right group was Brody, pointing out he was a \u201cpolitical science student at a liberal school on a career path towards the feds.\u201d   \u201cVery odd,\u201d Musk responded.   Another user shared the tweet alleging Brody\u2019s involvement and commented, \u201cRemember when they called us conspiracy theorists for saying the feds were planting fake Nazis at rallies?\u201d   \u201cAlways remove their masks,\u201d Musk replied.   On June 27, having engaged with conspiracy theories about the subject over a number of days, Musk alleged that the Oregon skirmish was a false flag. \u201cLooks like one is a college student (who wants to join the govt) and another is maybe an Antifa member, but nonetheless a probable false flag situation,\u201d he tweeted.   \u201cI knew that this was snowballing, but once Elon Musk commented, I was like, \u2018boom, that\u2019s the final nail in the coffin,\u2019\u201d Brody recalled.   Musk has more followers than anyone else on X \u2013 approximately 150 million at the end of June, around the time he tweeted about the fight in Oregon, according to records from the Internet Archive.  That tweet has been viewed more than 1.2 million times, according to X\u2019s own data.   Brody worried his name would forever be associated with neo-Nazism, that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get a job. Though he had finished college, he hadn\u2019t yet graduated, and he said some of the accounts messaging him were threatening to contact his university. \u201cMy life is ruined,\u201d he thought.   Attempting to clear his name, he gave an interview to Vice.com, which caught the attention of Mark Bankston.   Bankston is best known as the lawyer who successfully took on the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in court on behalf of parents who lost their children in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting.   Bankston said Brody\u2019s case is not only an opportunity to help clear the young man\u2019s name but could also force what he views as a necessary conversation about the vitriolic nature of online discourse.   The lawsuit filed last month in Travis County, Texas (the same county in which Bankston successfully sued Jones), alleges Musk\u2019s claims about Brody are part of a \u201cserial pattern of slander\u201d by the billionaire.   Musk, the suit argues, is \u201cperhaps the most influential of all influencers, and his endorsement of the accusation against Ben galvanized other social media influencers and users to continue their attacks and harassment, as well as post accusations against Ben that will remain online forever.\u201d    Musk's X cashes in on 'superspreaders' of Israel-Hamas misinformation, new report finds   Soon after he took over Twitter in 2022, Musk said the platform must \u201cbecome by far the most accurate source of information about the world.\u201d   But, on the contrary, the suit alleges, \u201cMusk has been personally using the platform to spread false statements on a consistent basis while propping up and amplifying the most reprehensible elements of conspiracy-addled Twitter.\u201d   The suit outlines how Musk has engaged with accounts that traffic in racism and antisemitism and lists instances in which he publicly shared or engaged with conspiracy theories \u2013 including last October when he shared false claims about the attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.   The suit alleges that in August after Musk was made aware through his lawyers about Brody\u2019s case for defamation, Musk refused to delete his tweets.   Bankston and his client said the lawsuit is about a lot more than money.   \u201cI just want to make things right,\u201d Brody told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not about vengeance. I\u2019m not angry. It\u2019s not resentment. I just want to make things right, to get an apology, so that this doesn\u2019t happen again to anyone else.\u201d  Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

When was the last time you saw a live television news report from Ukraine? It\u2019s likely been a while.   The raging war in the Middle East has put the prolonged war in Eastern Europe largely on the back burner, in terms of media coverage, with Vladimir Putin\u2019s campaign of brutality against Ukraine receiving much less attention from the press than it did prior to the Israel-Hamas conflict breaking out.   Closed-captioning data from the Internet Television Archive, which was analyzed by the GDELT Project, showed that on cable news, coverage of the Ukraine war plummeted dramatically after Hamas\u2019 shocking Oct. 7 terror attack. In the days before the Israel-Hamas war, the battle in Ukraine amounted to about eight percent of CNN\u2019s television coverage. After the attacks, CNN \u2014the cable news network that provided the most Ukraine coverage \u2014 fell to under one percent.   As the chaos to elect a new House speaker ensnared Washington, there was a notable uptick in mentions of Ukraine on cable news networks \u2014 but the focus of the coverage mostly pertained to U.S. funding of the embattled nation, not the actual state of play in the war.   Data provided by ComScore, an Internet analytics firm, showed a similar trend play out online. The data indicated that there has been a significant drop in discussion on social media about the Ukraine war since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict, though it also indicated that in general, there had been a lull in attention to Putin\u2019s invasion in recent months.   The noted drop in Ukraine war coverage from the press, given the fresh violence in the Middle East, is not completely surprising. The horrific acts of violence Hamas carried out in Israel has shocked the world, arresting the attention of those who normally pay little regard to global affairs. U.S. outlets have also been juggling several other important stories in the last several weeks, including disarray in Congress, Donald Trump\u2019s legal issues and a monstrous mass shooting in Maine.   But, at the same time, the drop in attention paid to Ukraine has been nothing short of a boon for Putin. The authoritarian Russian leader, who has committed unspeakable atrocities as his forces invade a sovereign nation, has been able to wage his war with far less scrutiny on his appalling actions.   Paul Kolbe, a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs in Harvard Kennedy School, who served for 25 years in the Central Intelligence Agency, told me that Putin must be \u201cdelighted\u201d that the war between Israel and Hamas \u201cis diverting US attention\u201d as Russia \u201ccontinues to strike Ukrainian cities and civilian targets.\u201d   \u201cEven as Western press coverage of war in Ukraine wanes, Russia fills the vacuum in reporting with its own campaign of distributing lies and disinformation,\u201d Kolbe said. \u201cPutin\u2019s strategy is to wear down Western patience and support, play upon U.S. domestic divisions, and to prey upon those in NATO which harbor latent Russian sympathies.\u201d   In addition to the kinetic military action, Putin is also waging an information war, using all the tools at his disposal to lie about and sanitize the acts of savagery being committed against a civilian population under his orders. As Kolbe told me, \u201cPutin\u2019s media campaign to paint Ukraine as divided, corrupt, and a puppet of the U.S. and NATO, is a central part\u201d of his strategy.   The lack of press attention makes that all the more easier.  Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state\u2019s electoral votes.   By that time, Trump\u2019s loss in the state \u2013 by less than 11,000 votes \u2013 had already been certified by the state\u2019s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election.   But in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona\u2019s 11 \u201cRepublican electors,\u201d as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.   Instead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media.    Before he became a politician, House Speaker Mike Johnson partnered with an anti-gay conversion therapy group    Tom Emmer cast doubt on the 2020 election and supported lawsuit to throw election to Trump   Much attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona.   Now those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN.   \u201cThey were more brazen,\u201d Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. \u201cThere is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.\u201d   Attorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice.   \u201cIt\u2019s robust. It\u2019s a serious matter,\u201d Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.\u201d   All 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state\u2019s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed.   Of the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee.   Each of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol.   \u201cThe Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,\u201d Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN.   Electors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party\u2019s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president.   CNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them.   The most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the \u201ctrue electors,\u201d and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party\u2019s YouTube. Falsely saying the state\u2019s electoral votes were \u201ccontested,\u201d even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona\u2019s state legislature to decertify the state\u2019s results.   \u201cWe believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,\u201d she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents.   Ward\u2019s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act.   \u201cMy Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing \u2018Republican\u2019 gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!\u201d he wrote in a tweet on December 22.   Another prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies.   \u201cIt will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,\u201d Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents.   In repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence.   \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates\u2014 or none at all,\u201d wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet.   \u201cWe don\u2019t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn\u2019t democratic,\u201d he added when receiving pushback.   A spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors.   Bowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6.   \u201cBe a modern Son of Liberty today,\u201d he said late in the morning of January 6 \u2013 a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol.   The spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes\u2019s office or the DOJ.   Newly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona\u2019s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature.   \u201cIt is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,\u201d wrote Hoffman.   In interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because \u201cwe don\u2019t have certainty in the outcome of our election,\u201d and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent.   Then-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in office sharing \u201cstop the steal\u201d content and participating in their rallies. He said he was \u201chonored\u201d to be a Trump elector.   \u201cOn January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he\u2019s going to choose,\u201d Kern told the Epoch Times in an interview in December.   \u201cThere is no president elect until January 6th,\u201d he added.   Kern hadn\u2019t changed his tune in an interview with CNN.   \u201cWhy, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,\u201d Kern said.   Kern repeatedly promoted the January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol.   \u201cIn DC supporting @realDonaldTrump and @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC are spewing lies again. #truth,\u201d he wrote in a tweet.   Later Kern was seen in a restricted area of the Capitol steps during the riot. There is no indication he was violent, and he has not been charged with any crime.

Adam Schiff claimed primary residences in Maryland and California | CNN Politics": " For more than a decade, California Senate hopeful Rep. Adam Schiff has claimed his primary residence is a 3,420 square foot home he owns in Maryland, according to a review of mortgage records.   At the same time, Schiff has for years taken a homeowner\u2019s tax exemption on a much smaller 650 square foot condo he owns in Burbank, California, also claiming that home as his primary residence for a $7,000 reduction off the 1% property tax, amounting to a roughly $70 in annual savings. He did not take an exemption on his home in Maryland.   While Schiff has signed documents asserting both the Maryland property and the significantly smaller Burbank condo as his primary residences, tax records indicate that he paid his California property taxes in 2017 with a check featuring his Maryland address \u2013 the only year he paid with a personal check. And a review of past comments, pictures shared on his public social media, and records indicate Schiff makes his full-time home in Maryland.   Schiff is in a competitive primary in California for the Senate seat against Democratic Reps. Katie Porter and Barbara Lee, and his dual residency claims could present a political problem for the congressman. Schiff announced his run in January 2023.   Deed records show Schiff, who was elected to Congress in 2000, designated the Maryland home as his primary residence in 2003. In 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 Schiff refinanced his mortgage and again indicated it was his primary residence.   Los Angeles County deed records for Schiff\u2019s Burbank condo, purchased in 2009, were notarized in Maryland. On one page of the deed, the state: California and the county: Los Angeles are crossed out and Maryland and Montgomery County are written in. The records also list Schiff\u2019s Maryland home as an address the records are being returned to.   Marisol Samayoa, a spokesperson for Schiff\u2019s campaign, asserted his primary residence was in California and said he had been open about it citing several news mentions and a mention in his book.   \u201cAdam\u2019s primary residence is Burbank, California, and will remain so when he wins the Senate seat,\u201d she told CNN in an email. \u201cAs Adam has discussed openly many times over the years, including in his recent New York Times best-selling book, he and Eve made the difficult decision to move their family to the D.C. area to spend more time with his children while doing his job.\u201d   His spokesperson also told CNN the properties were both claimed as primary residences for loan purposes.   \u201cAdam\u2019s California and Maryland addresses have been listed as primary residences for loan purposes because they are both occupied throughout the year and to distinguish them from a vacation property,\u201d she added.   Despite purchasing the home in Maryland two years into his tenure in Congress, a biography on his campaign website from 2010 to 2014 suggested Schiff was raising his family at his home in Burbank.   \u201cSettled in Burbank, CA, Adam and his wife Eve are the proud parents of daughter Alexa, age 13, and son Elijah, age 10,\u201d read the biography, which made no mention of his Maryland home.   In 2020, Schiff refinanced his mortgage indicating the Maryland house was his second home, but a social media post from 2021 suggested the congressman was still living at the home with his wife. A school publication and athletic records also show his son was attending a local high school at the time.   A family photo on his website in 2021 also matches the exterior of his Potomac home.   Various photos on social media within the last year, some of which were publicly posted by the congressman, have also indicated Schiff is still living in Maryland.   On June 7, 2022, on the day of Democratic primary in the Los Angeles mayor\u2019s race, Schiff posted a photo of himself wearing an \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker on Twitter in front of his Maryland home.   \u201cCalifornia! Los Angeles! Voters are voting\u2026.so go, VOTE !\u201d he wrote.   Schiff\u2019s spokesperson told CNN he was in Washington, DC, for House votes and voted by mail.   To qualify for a homeowner\u2019s exemption under California law, \u201ca dwelling must be the person\u2019s true, fixed and permanent home and principal establishment to which he/she, whenever absent, intends to return.\u201d\u00a0 Factors used to determine if someone lives in the state are, \u201cin-state presence, vehicle registration, voter registration, bank accounts, and state income tax filings.\u201d   Multiple real estate law experts with whom CNN\u2019s KFile spoke said Schiff is likely not in any legal jeopardy. The ambiguous language of the law means Schiff is likely legally in the clear in regard to his taxes and mortgage, and there is no group that tracks if other members of Congress fill out their tax and mortgage documents in a similar way. But the dual residency could still complicate his run for the Senate in the state\u2019s competitive primary and present a political problem.   \u201cOn the merits, technically there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with it,\u201d said Candace Turitto, a professor of political science at the University of Maryland. The US Constitution says that members of Congress must have an \u201cinhabitancy in the state at the time elected\u201d \u2013 a fairly vague requirement.   \u201cIt might not mean anything to voters,\u201d said Turitto, \u201cbut if one of these candidates can turn it into a larger argument about the quality of representation or integrity that Adam Schiff will display as a senator, it might work to create daylight in an otherwise tight primary campaign.\u201d   Residency concerns have plagued politicians running for Senate positions over the years, some mirroring Schiff\u2019s predicament.   In 2006, Republican Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania faced similar questions about living in Virginia full time with his family.   In 2022, Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz faced questions about his candidacy in Pennsylvania despite a longtime residency in New Jersey, as did Georgia Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker who is a longtime Texas resident.   In 2014, longtime Kansas Republican Sen. Pat Roberts faced questions about making his full-time home in Virginia.   This month, Sen. Laphonza Butler, who was appointed to the open seat left vacant by Dianne Feinstein after her death, was forced to re-register to vote in California when it was reported she too lived in Maryland at the time of her appointment.

In editorials that ran in his local Shreveport, Louisiana, paper, The Times, Johnson called homosexuality a \u201cinherently unnatural\u201d and \u201cdangerous lifestyle\u201d that would lead to legalized pedophilia and possibly even destroy \u201cthe entire democratic system.\u201d   And, in another editorial, \u201cYour race, creed, and sex are what you are, while homosexuality and cross-dressing are things you do,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is a free country, but we don\u2019t give special protections for every person\u2019s bizarre choices.\u201d   At the time, Johnson was an attorney and spokesman for Alliance Defense Fund, known today as Alliance Defending Freedom, where he also authored his opposition to the Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas \u2013 which overturned state laws that criminalized homosexual activity between consenting adults.   ADF wrote an amicus brief in the case which supported maintaining criminalization.   \u201cStates have many legitimate grounds to proscribe same-sex deviate sexual intercourse,\u201d Johnson wrote in a July 2003 op-ed, calling it a public health concern.   \u201cBy closing these bedroom doors, they have opened a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d he added.   On Thursday, Johnson was asked to respond to KFile\u2019s report on the editorials during a lengthy interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity.   \u201cI don\u2019t even remember some of them,\u201d Johnson told Hannity.   \u201cI was a litigator that was called upon to defend the state marriage amendments. If you remember back in the early 2000s there was over 35 states somewhere in that number that the people went to the ballot in their respective states and they amended their state constitutions to say marriage is one man, one woman. Well, I was a religious liberty defense lawyer and I was called to go in and defend those cases in the court,\u201d he said.   Johnson, who called himself a Bible-believing Christian, went on to say he genuinely loves all people \u201cregardless of their lifestyle choices\u201d\u00a0and that he respects the rule of law.   Johnson is now the speaker of the House at a time when a majority of Americans are strongly supportive of gay rights.   In the House Republican Conference\u2019s voting for their speaker nominee, Tom Emmer, who initially beat out Johnson, came under fire from conservatives for voting to codify same-sex marriage in 2022.   Johnson, according to Punchbowl News, reportedly made an issue of Emmer\u2019s vote. Johnson voted against the bill. In 2022, Johnson also introduced a bill that some describe as a national version of what critics have called Florida\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill.   In the mid-2000s, Johnson\u2019s anti-gay rhetoric was harsh. In September 2004, Johnson wrote in support of a Louisiana amendment banning same-sex marriage saying it could lead to people marrying their pets.   \u201cHomosexual relationships are inherently unnatural and, the studies clearly show, are ultimately harmful and costly for everyone,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSociety cannot give its stamp of approval to such a dangerous lifestyle. If we change marriage for this tiny, modern minority, we will have to do it for every deviant group. Polygamists, polyamorists, pedophiles, and others will be next in line to claim equal protection. They already are. There will be no legal basis to deny a bisexual the right to marry a partner of each sex, or a person to marry his pet.\u201d   Johnson added that allowing same-sex marriage could be the downfall of the democratic system.   \u201cThe state and its citizens have a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of the marital union by making opposite-sex marriage the exclusive form of family relationship endorsed by the government,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLoss of this status will de-emphasize the importance of traditional marriage to society, weaken it, and place our entire democratic system in jeopardy by eroding its foundation.\u201d   In another 2004 column, Johnson again predicted same-sex marriage could doom America.   \u201cIf you were shocked by the moral lapses at the Super Bowl you ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cExperts project that homosexual marriage is the dark harbinger of chaos and sexual anarchy that could doom even the strongest republic.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Jon Tester failed to fulfill multiple promises he made in a public ethics pledge during his first Senate campaign in 2006, including a vow to publicly post meetings between members of his Senate staff and lobbyists.   CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed lofty promises made by the Montana Democrat when he was running against a Republican he successfully painted as a Washington insider tied to lobbyists. On this point and some others, Tester \u2013 who is running for reelection in 2024 \u2013 failed to follow through on his commitment.   \u201cI\u2019ll end secret meetings with lobbyists. At the end of every business day, I will post a list of every in-office meeting that I or my staff has had with a lobbyist,\u201d Tester pledged in 2006.   But a review of archived versions of Tester\u2019s Senate website shows that while he did post his own meetings, no staff meetings were ever posted \u2013 which an expert noted would leave out most of the crucial work being done on legislation by special interest groups.   \u201cThe staffers are the ones collecting all the information in the beginning, trying to understand all the issues so that they can brief their boss in the first place, and that requires extensive meetings with the lobbyists, typically,\u201d said Kedric Payne, the vice president of Campaign Legal Center, a non-partisan ethics and campaign watchdog group.   Payne added that the relationships between congressional staffers and lobbyists are \u201cvery close\u201d \u2013 lobbyists provide expertise to staffers, who give lobbyists a way to advocate for their clients.   Congressional ethics and the fraud and bribery scandal involving GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff were center stage in Tester\u2019s 2006 race against Republican Senator Conrad Burns. Burns found himself under fire for ties to Abramoff, who went to jail over the scandal and was known for providing gifts, trips and campaign donations to members of Congress. Burns eventually returned $150,000 in campaign donations that he received from Abramoff and his clients and associates.   Two weeks after the 2006 election, Tester reiterated his support for limiting the influence of lobbyists by posting meetings.   \u201cI know that\u2019s tough when it comes to staff and offices this size,\u201d Tester said on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cBut the fact is the people back home need to know who we\u2019re meeting with so that they have the opportunity to put their two bits in too.\u201d   In 2006, the Montana Democrat also vowed to advocate for stricter rules for lobbyists on meetings with Congressional offices. During the campaign, Tester said he would \u201cwork to require all lobbyists to declare on a publicly available website, on a weekly basis, every meeting they have with a member\u2019s office.\u201d   But a review of the legislation Tester sponsored or co-sponsored found no such requirements were ever introduced. In July, he reintroduced a bill he\u2019s supported since 2014 that would ban members of Congress from becoming lobbyists.   Tester\u2019s office did not dispute he had not introduced a bill on this topic but provided internal emails showing in July 2023 his office inquired about working on a new bill requiring monthly disclosures of meetings with members of Congress. And while his office did not acknowledge the lack of the fulfilled pledge, they said he had led on fulfilling his pledge in other ways.   \u201cSenator Tester kept his promise to Montanans to go above and beyond every other Member of Congress when it comes to ethics, transparency, and good governance,\u201d said Sarah Feldman, Tester\u2019s communications director. \u201cHe was the first, and remains one of the only Members to post his public schedule daily, is leading efforts to close the revolving door of lobbyist influence in D.C., and is the only Senator to routinely conduct audits of his office. He hopes his colleagues will join him in these efforts.\u201d   Since his first term, Tester\u2019s campaign and office have touted that he is one of the only members of Congress to post his schedule, including meetings, online each business day, including meetings. Tester and Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, reintroduced legislation in July to require all members to post their schedules at the end of each month.   Though Tester initially pledged to post his schedule every day, a CNN review found the schedule was posted sporadically \u2013 sometimes with weekly or monthly updates instead of daily. In 2021, Fox News reported there was a nearly three-month gap when Tester\u2019s schedule was not posted, which his office said was due to staff error.   Tester\u2019s 2006 pledge only covers meetings done as official Senate business, and Tester does not publicly post campaign-related meetings that might involve lobbyists.   Still, over the years Tester has co-sponsored and supported legislation that strengthened the ethics regulations on members of Congress and lobbyists.  For instance, Tester introduced legislation that would implement a lifetime ban on members of Congress from ever becoming lobbyists along with much stricter regulations for lobbyists.   Tester\u2019s office noted he did ban all lobbyist gifts for him and staff and does not allow former members of the Senate or staff to lobby him \u2013 as he promised in 2006. The office also said he fulfilled one big aspect of his 2006 ethics pledge: promising to have Montana judges conduct an audit of his office \u201cevery year.\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s important to me that the people of Montana know exactly how my staff and I conduct the people\u2019s business,\u201d Tester said in a 2008 op-ed.   \u201cAnd I\u2019ll share that audit with the people of Montana,\u201d he later added.   Though Tester\u2019s campaign and office frequently promoted the audits of Tester\u2019s office, CNN found no examples of the office posting about them since 2012 or sharing the results.   Tester\u2019s office did provide CNN the names of judges, who they say conducted the audits in the years since 2012. Tester\u2019s team chose the judges who would complete the audits, which according to Tester\u2019s office affirmed his commitment to ethical governance and found no issues, and at least two of the five judges involved in public audits were donors or had a spouse who was a donor to his 2006 campaign.   The judge who conducted the audit in the 111th Congress in 2011, donated several thousand dollars to Tester\u2019s 2006 campaign. The wife of the judge who conducted the audit in the 110th in 2009 Congress donated $1250 to Tester\u2019s 2006 campaign as well.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

In a December 2020 radio interview reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile, Meshawn Maddock, one of the 16 fake electors in Michigan charged by the state attorney general for the alleged scheme, detailed the Trump campaign-directed plan and said the crucial decision on which electors to use would ultimately rest with a constitutional attorney and Vice President Mike Pence and Congress.   The newly uncovered interview reveals Maddock\u2019s detailed knowledge of the Trump campaign\u2019s involvement in the plot and undermines her more recent comments claiming only a \u201cvague\u201d recollection of it when asked about CNN reporting from last year \u2013 which first reported on the Trump campaign\u2019s alleged involvement in the scheme, according to three sources with direct knowledge.   While Maddock has previously claimed the fake GOP electors were not meant to replace the legitimate Democratic ones, even in the December 2020 interview, her newly uncovered comments about Pence show her understanding that the slate of fake electors could eventually usurp the legitimate elector votes on January 6, 2021.   Despite Trump losing the state by more than 150,000 votes, Maddock and 15 others signed phony certificates claiming to be the legitimate electors from the state just days before the interview and attempted to enter their state capitol to deliver the votes.   \u201cI\u2019m no constitutional attorney,\u201d Maddock said on December 16, 2020, in an interview with local radio host Steve Gruber. \u201cI\u2019m an elector for Donald Trump from the Michigan Republican Party. I along with the other 15 electors were guided by legal minds \u2013 attorneys for our president, some very incredible constitutional attorneys \u2013 I\u2019ve never in my whole life appreciated legal minds and attorneys before.\u201d   She did not name the Trump attorneys who were involved.   \u201cI can tell you that in the last few weeks, just some incredible minds,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd from what I understand, you know, you have the federal constitutional law, and then you have state statutes, um, and they\u2019re two different things. So, what we did, uh, along with seven other states, really send in dueling electors, and that will be there before, um, you know, a federal constitutional attorney, and it\u2019ll be before, uh, Mike Pence and Congress to make that decision.\u201d   Maddock, the wife of a conservative member of the state legislature, would go on to serve as co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party after the 2020 election and preside over historic losses for Michigan Republicans in the 2022 midterms.   She parroted some of Trump\u2019s most controversial false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election and eventually deleted a tweet spreading the unfounded conspiracy theory that Dominion Voting Systems had changed votes in the election.   In the December 2020 interview, Maddock cited the 1960 election in Hawaii in which pro-Kennedy electors were also sent to the National Archives \u2013 an argument cited by Trump campaign attorneys in memos that outlined their fake elector plans.   \u201cI think the last time was in 1960, the state of Hawaii sent in a dueling slate,\u201d Maddock said.   There are key differences between the 2020 election in Michigan and the 1960 election in Hawaii. Richard Nixon\u2019s win of the state was reversed after a recount with John F. Kennedy getting the state\u2019s electoral votes. Nixon and Kennedy were separated at the time of the recount by less than 150 votes. Biden led Trump by more than 150,000 votes in Michigan and the result was never in doubt.   Maddock declined to comment on this report.   Despite demonstrating an understanding of how exactly the plan to use fake electors worked in December 2020, Maddock has since said she doesn\u2019t have much recollection of the details.   \u201cA lot of that is still vague to me. And I don\u2019t have any email communications with any of these people,\u201d Maddock said when asked which attorneys asked her to sign the fake election documents in another interview with Steve Gruber in July 2023.   Maddock seemingly placed blame on the last state party chairperson.   \u201cLaura Cox was our state party chair at the time, somebody from her staff contacted all of us, asked us to be at the Michigan Republican Party office at 2 pm,\u201d Maddock said.   Cox said in a deposition with the House select committee that investigated January 6, 2021, she was asked by the Trump campaign to \u201cfacilitate having the electors meet and sign some sort of document,\u201d which Cox said made her uncomfortable.   \u201cSo, we came up with a document that we would have them have a ceremonial meeting, and one person would sign a document stating that if perhaps something were to happen in the courts, they were willing and able to serve as electors from Michigan for Donald Trump and Mike Pence,\u201d Cox said.   In July, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel charged Maddock and the 15 others for their roles in the Trump campaign\u2019s plan to subvert the Electoral College and overturn the 2020 election results by supplanting lawful Democratic electors with fake Republican electors.   Each of the fake Michigan electors were charged with eight state felonies: two counts of forgery, one count of conspiracy to commit forgery, two counts of election law forgery, one count of conspiracy to commit election law forgery, one count of publishing a counterfeit record and one count of conspiring to publish a counterfeit record. Each person pleaded not guilty to the felony charges.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Tailei Qi, the grad student, was charged with first-degree murder and having a gun on education property in court Tuesday. He did not enter a plea and was ordered held without bond.   The victim was identified as Zijie Yan, an associate professor in the department of Applied Physical Sciences who had worked for UNC since 2019.   The two knew each other, UNC Police Chief Brian James said Tuesday.   Qi was a grad student in the same department and Yan was his faculty adviser, according to Qi\u2019s UNC biographical page, which has been deleted but is available on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. Qi entered the school in 2022 and listed his previous education as Louisiana State University and Wuhan University, the page said.   Qi entered the courtroom Tuesday wearing an orange jail outfit with his hands cuffed in front of him. He used an interpreter and was assigned a public defender for his first appearance. He is a citizen of China and is in the United States on a visa, District Attorney Jeff Nieman said.   Nieman said the gun possession charge was related to a 9 mm handgun. The firearm used in the shooting still has not been recovered, James said.   If convicted, Qi faces a minimum of life in prison without parole for the murder charge and up to two years for the weapons charge. The maximum sentence for first-degree murder in North Carolina is the death penalty, but Nieman has said his office policy is to not seek the death penalty.   UNC Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz expressed his condolences to Yan\u2019s family and said the campus will ring the bell tower in his honor on Wednesday.   \u201cHe was a beloved colleague, mentor and a friend to so many on our campus, and a father to two young children,\u201d he said.   The early afternoon shooting at the school\u2019s Caudill Laboratories, a chemistry studies building, sent the university into lockdown for hours.   The suspect was located on foot about a mile away and detained about 90 minutes afterward, James said. His car was found on campus, he said.   \u201cWe want to ensure that we gather every piece of evidence to determine exactly what happened here today and why it happened,\u201d James said at a news conference Monday evening. \u201cIt is too early in this investigation to know a motive for the shooting.\u201d   Classes and campus activities were canceled Monday and Tuesday, and will continue to be closed Wednesday, officials said. This is the second week of fall semester classes at the flagship university of the 17-member UNC system.   \u201cThis loss is devastating and the shooting damages the trust and safety that we so often take for granted in our campus community. We will work to rebuild that sense of trust and safety within our community,\u201d Guskiewicz said on Monday.   After 911 calls about the shooting came in shortly after 1 p.m., university police issued an alert advising students to go inside immediately, close windows and doors and to wait until further notice, according to an email. A witness on campus told CNN they were locked down in their building and saw armed officers searching campus.    University of North Carolina faculty member is killed in campus shooting, and a suspect is in custody, school says   Video from CNN affiliate WRAL showed a large number of police vehicles at the campus with their emergency lights flashing. At times, people walked out of nearby buildings in a single-file line with their arms in the air.   Police detained one person before the suspect\u2019s arrest but they determined \u201cvery quickly\u201d it was not the gunman, James said.   The suspect was taken into custody shortly after 2:30 p.m., Guskiewicz said. The university continued in lockdown for a couple hours after the suspect was detained because authorities were working to confirm they had the right person and trying to find the firearm that was used, James told reporters.   This is the second week of the fall semester at the school. The university has a student body population of about 32,000, along with more than 4,000 faculty and 9,000 staff members.   The FBI is assisting in evidence gathering, officials said.   Forty-nine school shootings have happened in the US this year, including the UNC shooting \u2013 34 have been reported on K-12 campuses and 15 on university and college campuses \u2013 according to a CNN tally.

Videos and photographs reviewed by CNN show the man dutifully recording Jones with his phone as the bombastic media personality ascended to the restricted area of the Capitol grounds where mobs of then-President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters eventually broke in.   While the man\u2019s actions outside the Capitol that day have drawn little scrutiny, his alleged connections to a plot to overthrow the 2020 election have recently come into sharp focus: He is attorney Kenneth Chesebro, the alleged architect of the scheme to subvert the 2020 Electoral College process by using fake GOP electors in multiple states.   When asked by the House select committee where he was the first week of January 2021 and on January 6, Chesebro invoked his Fifth Amendment rights. But a CNN investigation has placed him outside of the Capitol at the same time as his alleged plot to keep Trump in office unraveled inside it.   There is no indication Chesebro entered the Capitol Building or was violent. Jones did not enter the Capitol on January 6, 2021, or engage in violence, but he had warned of a coming battle the day before and urged his supporters to converge on the Capitol.   Chesebro is the only one of the unindicted co-conspirators in Trump\u2019s recent federal indictment and only member of Trump\u2019s legal efforts who is now known to have been on the Capitol grounds on January 6.   CNN was able to place Chesebro at the protest through publicly available databases with photos and videos from that day. Interviews with his acquaintances also confirmed his identity. Chesebro declined CNN\u2019s requests for comment, citing ongoing litigation.   It was unclear why Chesebro was following Jones on January 6.   \u201cEven if Chesebro is simply a diehard Infowars fan, I think that would further illustrate how thin the line was between the serious, credentialed people who sought to undermine election results and the extremist figures who sought to unleash havoc was in that period, to the extent it meaningfully existed at all,\u201d said Jared Holt, an expert at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue which investigates extremism, hate and disinformation.   Until 2022, the extent of Chesebro\u2019s involvement in the alleged plot to subvert the 2020 election was relatively unknown. The Harvard-educated attorney is now indicted in Fulton County, Georgia, along with Trump and 17 others with prosecutors alleging they were involved in a criminal conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in Georgia in favor of Trump.   Chesebro\u2019s path to Trump\u2019s orbit was untraditional. He is a former research assistant of Harvard professor Laurence Tribe, one of the nation\u2019s most esteemed liberal constitutional scholars. Chesebro reportedly said he made a small fortune in cryptocurrency and by 2020 was donating thousands to Republican candidates.   In November 2020, he began his work advising the Trump campaign attorney Jim Troupis on the potential to use fake electors in Wisconsin, first reported by the New York Times.   Chesebro later wrote a series of memos that outlined plans in which fake Trump electors in states won by Biden might be recognized \u201cby a court, the state legislature, or Congress.\u201d   In a December 2020 email exchange between Chesebro and John Eastman, another architect of the fake electors\u2019 scheme, discovered by the House select committee investigating January 6, Chesebro suggested that \u201cchaos\u201d on January 6 could pressure Supreme Court justices to act before the count could occur. He wrote, the \u201codds of action before Jan. 6 will become more favorable if the justices start to fear that there will be \u2018wild\u2019 chaos on Jan. 6 unless they rule by then, either way.\u201d   In Trump\u2019s recent federal indictment, Chesebro was identified by CNN as co-conspirator 5 \u2014 described by prosecutors as an attorney \u201cwho assisted in devising and attempting to implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding.\u201d   On January 6, photos and videos show Chesebro with Jones for about an hour, starting a short distance from Capitol at around 1:40 p.m. As Jones and his entourage make their way to the Capitol, Chesebro followed with his phone out, seemingly recording Jones.   CNN recreated Chesebro\u2019s movements using deleted video clips from the conservative social media site Parler, photos from Twitter, footage from Infowars and video from Jones\u2019 own bodyguard\u2019s body camera \u2013 previously published by Infowars \u2013 along with video compiled by amateur researchers who tracked Jones\u2019 movements.   Videos reviewed by CNN show Chesebro with Jones in two sections of the restricted area around the Capitol cited in a federal indictment against Owen Shroyer \u2013 another host on Infowars \u2013 who was with Jones in those areas at the same time as Chesebro.   Shroyer, who had previously signed a deferred prosecution agreement in another case saying he would not engage in disorderly conduct on the Capitol grounds, was charged with four misdemeanors. Shroyer later pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of entering and remaining on the restricted grounds.   Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN that Chesebro\u2019s presence on the Capitol grounds could be cited by prosecutors.   \u201cRegardless of Chesebro\u2019s potential criminal liability for being in the restricted areas of Capitol grounds, this evidence could be cited by prosecutors as further proof that Chesebro was not operating as a bona fide legal advisor but rather was an activist aligned in the cause to overturn the election,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cIt undercuts defenses Chesebro might mount that he was functioning only in the role of providing legal advice for clients.\u201d   Footage shows Chesebro front and center recording Jones as he gives an impromptu speech on the West Lawn of the Capitol grounds urging supporters not to fight police and to make their way to the other side of the Capitol where they have a permit. As Alex Jones and his entourage leave, the West side of the Capitol is breached.   Chesebro follows Jones and his entourage to the other side of the Capitol and at one point appears to show something on his phone to a member of Jones\u2019 security team at approximately 2:09 p.m., one recording shows. Later, the group, including Chesebro, make their way halfway up the steps of the Capitol Building before heading down.   Shortly after they leave, a mob trying to force the doors of the East side of the Capitol would push their way through.   Chesebro follows members of the group as they depart the Capitol grounds close to 3 p.m.   Later, Chesebro can be seen walking near the Peace Monument at the front of the Capitol.   In a deposition with the January 6th Committee in October 2022, Chesebro invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when asked if he had been in Washington, DC in January 2021 leading up to the certification of the results. An email obtained by the Committee shows Chesebro saying he would be staying at the Trump International Hotel in DC from the 3rd to the 8th of January.   A video reviewed by CNN shows Chesebro at Freedom Plaza a day earlier on January 5 ahead of a rally that also included speeches from Jones and Shroyer.

Officials are in a race against time to find a civilian submersible that had five people aboard after it went missing Sunday in the North Atlantic while voyaging to the wreckage of the Titanic.   The 21-foot vessel has four days of emergency capability, the leader of search and rescue efforts said Monday afternoon, as crews with the US and Canadian coast guards continued scouring the ocean\u2019s surface about 900 miles east of Cape Cod and used sonar to listen for sounds far below the water, which is up to 13,000 feet deep in the area.   The five people on board the vessel, which was on an expedition to view the Titanic wreckage, comprised one pilot and four \u201cmission specialists,\u201d Rear Adm. John Mauger, commander of the US Coast Guard\u2019s First District, said Monday in a news conference. He didn\u2019t identify the five and said authorities still were in the process of contacting family members.   He referred reporters to the group conducting the expedition, OceanGate Expeditions, for information about what the term \u201cmission specialist\u201d entails.   See our live coverage here.   \u201cWe\u2019re working very closely at this point to make sure that we\u2019re doing everything that we can do to locate the submersible and rescue those on board,\u201d Mauger said.   The Canadian research ship Polar Prince on Sunday notified the military branch it had lost contact with the underwater vessel, according to Coast Guard spokesperson Lt. Samantha Corcoran. In a tweet, the Coast Guard said the communication stopped approximately 1 hour, 45 minutes into the vessel\u2019s dive.   Time is a factor, officials said. \u201cIn terms of the hours, we understood that that was 96 hours of rescue or emergency capability from the operator,\u201d Mauger told reporters. \u201cAnd so we anticipate that there\u2019s somewhere between 70 to the full 96 hours available at this point.\u201d   A British businessman based in the United Arab Emirates, Hamish Harding, is one of the people on the submersible, according to a social media post by the company he owns, Action Aviation.   \u201cThe sub had a successful launch and Hamish is currently diving,\u201d the company said in an Instagram post on Sunday.   Harding was one of the first people to travel the Challenger Deep in the Pacific Ocean \u2013 the deepest known point on Earth. On Saturday he wrote of the Titanic mission: \u201cI am proud to finally announce that I joined OceanGate Expeditions for their RMS TITANIC Mission as a mission specialist on the sub going down to the Titanic.\u201d   C-130 aircraft were searching the surface and two P-8 planes that use sonar to find submarines were part of the search efforts, Mauger said Monday. Commercial ships are also involved and one has sonar, he added.   \u201cOftentimes, we rely on commercial operators to be the first vessels on scene,\u201d Mauger said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019ve been in touch with additional commercial vessels that are operating in the area as well as initiating the movement of additional Canadian Coast Guard assets and US Coast Guard surface assets into the area over the course of the next couple of days.\u201d   The US Coast Guard also has been in touch with the US Navy and the Canadian military to determine what underwater rescue capability is available, if needed, Mauger said.   OceanGate is assisting in the search and said it is \u201cexploring and mobilizing all options to bring the crew back safely.\u201d   \u201cOur entire focus is on the crewmembers in the submersible and their families. We are deeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to reestablish contact with the submersible,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe are working toward the safe return of the crewmembers.\u201d   Chief Mi\u2019sel Joe of Miawpukek First Nation, which co-owns the Polar Prince, the support vessel on the expedition, said he received a call Sunday afternoon alerting him the sub was two hours overdue and still hadn\u2019t surfaced, and they had lost communication with the sub. At that point, requests for search and rescue had gone out, he said.   The US Coast Guard tweeted Monday night that its C-130\u2019s had returned to North Carolina and the P-8\u2019s would resume their searches in the morning.   The Polar Prince and the Air National Guard\u2019s 106th Rescue Wing would continue surface searches through the evening, according to the Coast Guard.

There, up to five people, including a pilot, a \u201ccontent expert\u201d and three paying passengers, board a submersible named \u201cTitan\u201d and descend over two hours to the bottom of the ocean to see the Titanic up close.   According to OceanGate, Titan is a 23,000-pound submersible made of carbon fiber and titanium. As a safety feature, the sub uses a \u201cproprietary real-time hull health monitoring (RTM) system\u201d that analyzes the pressure on the vessel and the integrity of the structure, the company states.   The Titanic infamously hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912, killing more than 1,500 people. The wreckage of the Titanic, discovered in 1985, sits in two parts at the bottom of the ocean nearly 13,000 feet below the surface, southeast of Newfoundland.   Unlike a submarine, a submersible has limited power reserves so it needs a mother ship that can launch and recover it, according to NOAA.   An expedition participant on board the Polar Prince, the ship that launched the now-missing sub, said they are all \u201cfocused on board here for our friends.\u201d   \u201cWe have a situation that is now the part of a major Search and Rescue effort, being undertaken by major agencies,\u201d Rory Golden wrote on Facebook after being contacted by CNN. \u201cThat is where our focus is right now.\u201d   He asked people not to ask for or speculate on the names of those on the missing sub.   \u201cI have seen some comments already on social media that are highly inappropriate and insensitive,\u201d he said. He added their online and internet options were being restricted \u201cto keep bandwidth available for the coordinated effort that is taking place.\u201d   \u201cThe reaction and offers of help globally is truly astonishing, and only goes to show the real goodness in people at a time like this,\u201d he said.

In since unreported radio and television interviews from spring and summer 2012, Trump celebrated the interest in a 23-year-old transgender woman named Jenna Talackova participating in a Canadian pageant. He then later effusively praised the winner of the Miss USA pageant, Olivia Culpo, for saying that transgender women should be allowed to compete.   Trump, then the owner of the Miss Universe pageant, would go on to cite the possible participation of transgender women in Olympic sports to justify his decision to end a ban on transgender pageant participants.   But a decade later, as he geared up to run for a second White House term, Trump promised to \u201cban men from participating in women\u2019s sports,\u201d when speaking about transgender athletes \u2013 a reflection of how restricting trans rights has become a powerful talking point among conservatives and a potential a litmus test for Republican candidates.   Since launching his 2024 campaign Trump has also referred to gender-affirming surgery for minors as \u201cchild sexual mutilation,\u201d said he\u2019d seek to make such surgeries illegal if he returned to the White House, said he\u2019d sign executive orders instructing federal agencies not to promote transitioning at any age, and ask Congress to pass a bill requiring the government to only recognize only genders assigned at birth.   That\u2019s a departure from how he approached the inclusion of transgender people in society more than a decade ago.   For example, at the Miss USA pageant in June 2012, Culpo said she welcomed the participation of transgender women in the competition \u2013 a comment that Trump supported.   \u201cI do think that that would be fair, but I can understand that people would be a little apprehensive to take that road because there is a tradition of natural-born women,\u201d Culpo said when asked if transgender participants should be allowed. \u201cBut today where there are so many surgeries and so many people out there who have a need to change for a happier life, I do accept that because I believe it\u2019s a free country.\u201d   That seemed to go over well with Trump.   \u201cShe gave a great answer, a very tough question \u2013 on transgender \u2013 just the question everybody wants to hear, and she gave a great answer and she really did a great job,\u201d Trump said praising Culpo on Fox and Friends in June 2012.   \u201cIt was a very cool answer,\u201d added Trump. \u201cGreat, [she] gave a great answer.\u201d   \u201cHer answer was a very intelligent answer and that\u2019s one of the reasons I assume the judges picked her,\u201d Trump said in another June interview on Fox and Friends.   In 2012, Talackova was allowed to compete after threatening legal action over the Miss Universe organization ban on transgender contestants, which had come under scrutiny.   Trump claimed to CNN at the time he personally made the decision to end the ban before even knowing about the legal threats from Talackova\u2019s attorney, Gloria Allred.   A statement released by the Trump Organization at the time said the change was to modernize the pageant.   \u201cPageant rules have been modernized to ensure this type of issue does not occur again,\u201d read the statement, issued on Trump\u2019s behalf by his then-attorney Michael Cohen.   Cohen told CNN on Thursday the decision was made to follow Olympic guidelines on transgender athletes. At the time, the Olympics allowed the participation of transgender athletes who had sex reassignment surgery and two years of hormone therapy.   In an April 2012 appearance on \u201cThe Laura Ingraham Show,\u201d Trump celebrated the buzz associated with Talackova\u2019s entry into the pageant.   \u201cWell it became a big, big deal up in Canada,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you have the Miss Canada, which is essentially the Miss Universe. It\u2019s the pre-Miss Universe, it\u2019s the screening for Miss Universe \u2013 and a woman, transgender was in.\u201d   \u201cBut there\u2019s many, many, many contestants and they agreed to let her, based on the laws of Canada and the laws in the United States, they agreed to let her participate,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I will say there\u2019s, there\u2019s great interest and if you look at it from a show business standpoint, that\u2019s wonderful. But there is certainly great interest.\u201d   In an interview on Fox News also in April of 2012, Trump defended his decision to let Talackova compete.   \u201cIt has become a hot subject. It is being talked about all over the world right now,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a young woman, who, according to the laws of Canada and according to the laws of the United States, is allowed to enter the pageant system.\u201d   In the same interview, Trump cited the Olympics as part of his rationale.   \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a rule. This is sort of new territory. We are going by at some point, the Olympic rules because the Olympics are having a very big question about this \u2013 should this be allowed,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI said we have 58 contestants in Canada, I said let her run and maybe she will win and if she wins, she will go to Miss Universe. And I think I made the right decision, I feel fine with the decision.\u201d   Trump\u2019s decision was praised by the LGBTQ advocacy organization GLAAD at the time.   \u201cFor more than two weeks, the Miss Universe Organization and Mr. Trump made it clear to GLAAD that they were open to making a policy change to include women who are transgender. We appreciate that he and his team responded swiftly and appropriately,\u201d they said in a statement.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

In undisclosed radio interviews, Matthew Kacsmaryk referred to being gay as \u201ca lifestyle\u201d and expressed concerns that new norms for \u201cpeople who experience same-sex attraction\u201d would lead to clashes with religious institutions, calling it the latest in a change in sexual norms that began with \u201cno-fault divorce\u201d and \u201cpermissive policies on contraception.\u201d   Kacsmaryk, a Trump-appointed federal district judge, made the unreported comments in two appearances in 2014 on Chosen Generation, a radio show that offers \u201ca biblical constitutional worldview.\u201d At the time, Kacsmaryk was deputy general counsel at First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit religious liberty advocacy group known before 2016 as the Liberty Institute, and was brought on to the radio show to discuss \u201cthe homosexual agenda\u201d to silence churches and religious liberty, according to the show\u2019s host.   Federal judicial nominees are required to submit detailed paperwork to the Senate Judiciary Committee ahead of their confirmation process, including copies of nearly everything they have ever written or said in public, in order for the committee to evaluate a nominee\u2019s qualifications and personal opinions. Neither interview is listed in the paperwork Kacsmaryk provided to the Senate during his judicial nomination process, which first began in 2017.   The radio interviews were not included in the 22 media works Kacsmaryk disclosed, which included three radio appearances and 19 written pieces.   A spokesperson for Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN the interviews weren\u2019t in their archived files from Kacsmaryk\u2019s confirmation, which included all paperwork submitted for his nomination.   In a statement sent to CNN, Kacsmaryk said he did not locate the interview when searching for media to disclose and he did not recall the interview.   \u201cI used the DOJ-OLP manual to run searches for all media but did not locate this interview and did not recall this event, which involved a call-in to a local radio show,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cAfter listening to the audio file supplied by CNN, I agree that the content is equivalent to the legal analysis appearing throughout my SJQ and discussed extensively during my Senate confirmation hearing. Additionally, the transcript supplied by CNN appears to track with the audio and accurately recounts my responses during the phone call\u2014when quoted in full.\u201d   The Washington Post reported last week that Kacsmaryk removed his name in 2017 from a pending law review article criticizing protections for transgender people and those seeking abortions during his judicial nomination process, a highly unusual move for a judicial nominee.   Kacsmaryk did not respond to the Post\u2019s request for comment, but a spokesperson for his old employer First Liberty claimed Kacsmaryk\u2019s name had been a \u201cplaceholder\u201d on the article and that Kacsmaryk had not provided a \u201csubstantive contribution,\u201d despite the final version being almost identical to the one submitted under Kacsmaryk\u2019s name according to the Post.   Kacsmaryk later submitted supplemental material in 2019 to the committee to reflect interviews and events he participated since in 2017, but neither of the 2014 radio interviews were included.   Democratic senators grilled Kacsmaryk on his positions on abortion and LGBTQ rights during both his nomination hearing and in written questions in 2017.   While Kacsmaryk worked at First Liberty, one of his colleagues, general counsel Jeff Mateer, was also nominated for a federal judgeship. But Mateer came under scrutiny in 2017 for comments unearthed during his confirmation process in which he once compared the US to Nazi Germany on Chosen Generation \u2013 the same radio program Kacsmaryk appeared on and whose interviews he did not disclose.   Mateer\u2019s nomination was later rescinded; Kacsmaryk was later confirmed in 2019.   The interviews were shared by Kacsmaryk\u2019s employer, the Liberty Institute, at the time on social media. A guest from First Liberty appeared once a week, according to the show\u2019s radio host in the broadcast and archives available online.   In one interview from February 2014, in response to a question on the \u201chomosexual agenda,\u201d Kacsmaryk expressed concerns that new social norms surrounding \u201csame-sex marriage\u201d and \u201cpeople who experience same-sex attraction\u201d would lead to clashes with religious institutions.   \u201cI just want to make very clear, people who experience a same-sex attraction are not responsible individually or solely for the atmosphere of the sexual revolution,\u201d Kacsmaryk said. \u201cYou know it. It\u2019s a long time coming. It came after no-fault divorce. It came after we implemented very permissive policies on contraception. The sexual revolution has gone through several phases. We just happen to be at the phase now where same sex marriages is at the fore.\u201d   \u201cBut through that progression or regression, I think you can see five areas where there will be a clash of absolutes between the traditional Judeo-Christian understanding of marriage and the revisionist, redefined vision of marriage that you saw in last term\u2019s Supreme Court opinions,\u201d he said before outlining those areas as over tax exempt statuses, adoption services, federal government programs, and discrimination at universities.   He appeared on the program to discuss the federal government\u2019s view of same-sex marriage and opponents of it following the court ruling striking down the Defense of Marriage Act. The host suggested opponents of same-sex marriage could be viewed as \u201chostile\u201d enemies of the government in line with al-Qaeda, which Kacsmaryk agreed with.   \u201cYeah, and I can speak from immediate firsthand experience,\u201d he said, citing his work formerly in the Justice Department. \u201cThat is very much in vogue now in the federal government to characterize opposition to same sex marriage and related issues as irrational prejudice at best and a potential hate crime at worse,\u201d he continued.   \u201cIt really has infused the entire federal service top to bottom as the administration has declared that they will join this culture war, that there\u2019s one side that is destined to win and that you\u2019re on the wrong side of history in the federal government if you are on an opposing side,\u201d he added.   Kacsmaryk also appeared on the program in July 2014 to discuss an executive order signed by then-President Barack Obama that banned federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity which did not exempt faith-based groups.   Kacsmaryk linked changes in Democrats\u2019 views on the issue of religious freedom to the \u201cemergence of this very powerful constituency in the LGBT community,\u201d which he said the Obama administration made campaign promises to fulfill. Kacsmaryk said religious organizations entering into contracts with the federal government would have risk under the executive order and face a \u201creal burden\u201d for dissenting from \u201cthe new sexual orthodoxy\u201d on gay rights.   The new rules, Kacsmaryk suggested, were poorly written and didn\u2019t differentiate between gay people who lived \u201ccelibate\u201d lives and those who made being gay \u201ca lifestyle,\u201d in a discussion of how religious groups would comply with the new rules.   \u201cIf you look at the letter that was issued by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, they point out that the category sexual orientation is problematic because it\u2019s not defined,\u201d he said. \u201cMost Abrahamic faith traditions will draw a distinction between someone who experiences the same sex attraction but is willing to live celibate and somebody who experiences the same sex attraction and makes it a lifestyle and seeks to sexualize that lifestyle. Those are two different categories that most Abrahamic faith traditions recognize.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Our 2nd Amendment was put in place to protect us from aspiring tyrants.\u201d   This is not the first time Karamo espoused controversial and sometimes bizarre comments, which are almost too numerous to list in their entirety, according to a CNN KFile review of her comments, mostly made over the last few years.   Karamo has claimed in the past that Beyonc\u00e9 was secretly recruiting Black Americans to Paganism through a new album; that \u201cdemonic possession is real\u201d and transferred via \u201cintimate relationships\u201d; and that acceptance of gay and transgender Americans will lead to the acceptance of pedophilia.   She has said that the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement are \u201cMarxist witches\u201d; that the theory of evolution is \u201cone of the biggest scams ran on us in human history\u201d; and that doing drugs is \u201cwitchcraft.\u201d She has compared abortion to Pagan child sacrifice.   In the past, Karamo has also compared the media to Nazi Germany, saying media rhetoric about Republicans will lead to them being rounded up, killed and put in concentration camps.   A proud anti-vaxxer, Karamo has also said she doesn\u2019t believe in vaccines \u2013 saying she won\u2019t vaccinate her children and has only taken one vaccine herself.   After losing every statewide office and full control of the state government for the first time in nearly 40 years, Michigan Republicans elected Karamo \u2013 who made these comments and many others within the last few years \u2013 as their new state party chairwoman and the first Black person to lead the state party.   Karamo, an election denier who believes the 2020 presidential race was stolen, has also refused to concede her own 2022 race for Michigan Secretary of State, which she lost by 14 percentage points \u2013 the most lopsided loss of any statewide candidate last year.   Before she entered politics, Karamo worked as a community college professor and earned a master\u2019s degree in Christian apologetics.   Karamo did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment.   Here is what the leader of Michigan\u2019s state Republican party has said on a variety of issues.   Karamo, who has served on the board of Michigan\u2019s Right to Life organization and on the board of an anti-abortion pregnancy crisis center affiliate in Detroit, is staunchly opposed to abortion. She has called abortion \u201cchild sacrifice\u201d and a \u201csatanic practice,\u201d as CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported.   \u201cAbortion is really nothing new. The child sacrifice is a very satanic practice, and that\u2019s precisely what abortion is. And we need to see it as such,\u201d Karamo said in an October 2020 episode of her podcast \u201cIt\u2019s Solid Food.\u201d   \u201cWhen people in other cultures, when they engage in child sacrifice, they didn\u2019t just sacrifice the child for the sake of bloodshed,\u201d Karamo said later in the episode. \u201cThey sacrificed the child cuz they were hoping to get prosperity and that\u2019s precisely why people have abortion now. \u2018Because I\u2019m not ready. I don\u2019t wanna have a baby. I don\u2019t feel like it. I don\u2019t have time. I wanna make more money. I want my freedom.\u2019 So you\u2019re sacrificing that child hoping to get something out of their death, which is your freedom, your happiness, your prosperity.\u201d   In another episode from July 2020, Karamo said that humans have sacrificed other humans, including their own children, for \u201cthousands of years, just packaged differently.\u201d   \u201c[People] were sacrificing them to these deities, which were really demons,\u201d she said.   In other media reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile, Karamo called abortion the \u201cgreatest crime in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d   Karamo has repeatedly attacked the LGBTQ community, accusing them of indoctrinating people with \u201csexual perversion\u201d and equating acceptance of transgender people with the normalization of pedophilia.   In a November 2020 episode of her podcast, she said that the LGBTQ movement would \u201cindoctrinate [people] with sexual perversion,\u201d and that \u201cpedophilia is going to be normalized.\u201d   Karamo has baselessly connected transgender acceptance to pedophilia on several occasions.   \u201cThis is why people say the whole transgenderism movement is going to lead to the normalization of pedophilia.\u201d she said in an October 2020 podcast episode.   \u201cBecause if you\u2019re going to say the children have the sexual autonomy to change their gender, then how can you logically say they lack the sexual autonomy to have sex with an adult. You can\u2019t, those things go against one another, it\u2019s incoherent. It doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she added.   In the same episode, Karamo dismissed transgender identity as \u201ca mental problem\u201d and \u201cridiculous.\u201d   A devout Christian, Karamo has framed most things outside of her worldview as a direct result of \u201cSatanism,\u201d condemning everything from yoga (which she called a \u201csatanic ritual\u201d) to popular musicians to Democrats as \u201cevil.\u201d   As the liberal watchdog Media Matters first reported, Karamo has baselessly accused music stars like Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Cardi B, Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish of being tools of Satan. She claimed Beyonc\u00e9 used an album to convert Black Americans to paganism; that Cardi B was a \u201ctool of Lucifer because she peddles filth in the culture\u201d; and that Grande and Eilish put children under a \u201csatanic delusion.\u201d   She has also said that the \u201csexual revolution\u201d was a \u201cwell thought-out orchestrated plan by Satan.\u201d   \u201cAnd you can see his fingerprints all over it, all over it, regarding how well organized it is and how effective it has been in encouraging and pushing people to rebel against God, causing all types of societal harm and ultimately causing so many souls to be lost into hell,\u201d said Karamo in a September 2020 podcast.   Karamo has also denounced the Black Lives Matter movement, calling it \u201cnothing but Marxism and Satanism in blackface.\u201d   In a September 2020 podcast, she claimed Black Lives Matter\u2019s leaders were \u201cMarxist witches\u201d and said,\u201dit\u2019s rooted in Pagan religion, and you\u2019re channeling spirits and you\u2019re performing satanic rituals to get your movement done.\u201d   Karamo also believes that demonic possession is real, claiming it can be transmitted through \u201cintimate relationships.\u201d   \u201cIf a person has demonic possession \u2014 I know it\u2019s gonna sound really crazy to me saying that for some people, thinking like what?!\u201d Karamo said in September 2020. \u201cBut having intimate relationships with people who are demonically possessed or oppressed \u2014 I strongly believe that a person opens themselves up to possession. Demonic possession is real.\u201d   An election denier who was backed by former President Donald Trump during her secretary of state race in 2022, Karamo has made unsupported allegations about threats to conservatives.   In a podcast shortly after the 2020 election, Karamo criticized the mainstream media and claimed it had promoted imprisoning and killing Trump\u2019s supporters, comparing the media to Nazi Germany.   \u201cMajor news outlets are peddling that me and you need to die, we need to be dead or put in camps. Because again, how else do you remove people from society? By either killing them or putting them in camps? That\u2019s it, there\u2019s no other way to remove people from society. So they\u2019re either calling for us to die or be put in camps, all because we back President Trump,\u201d she said.   \u201cLike I just mentioned earlier about Hitler. He got to that point. He didn\u2019t just wake up one day and say \u2018Okay, everybody, we\u2019re gonna round up all the Jews, put \u2018em in concentration camps, kill \u2018em.\u2019\u201d Karamo continued. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just step by step by step by step it got to that point. And it started with what the people on MSNBC are doing.\u201d   She predicted that if court disputes over the election did not end favorably for Trump, \u201clists\u201d would be made to remove, imprison or kill Republicans.   \u201cIf things do not go the way I hope they do through the courts for President Trump, it\u2019s gonna be hell,\u201d Karamo said.   \u201cThey\u2019re calling for lists to be made. Tell me one Republican that\u2019s calling for everyday Democrats and liberals and leftists to be put in camps or killed, removed from society, denied jobs, lists made,\u201d she added.   Karamo has also characterized herself as an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d and peddled false claims about vaccination.   In a July 2020 podcast episode, she said she didn\u2019t believe in vaccination and would not vaccinate her children. In a December 2020 episode, she said she had only been vaccinated once, during her childhood.   \u201cI\u2019m an unvaccinated person. I have \u2013 my mom gave me one vaccine when I was a little,\u201d Karamo said.   Karamo made nonsensical claims distinguishing inoculation from vaccination. According to the definitions laid out by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is virtually no difference between the terms, which refer to steps of the same process and may be used interchangeably.   As defined by the CDC, vaccination refers to the act of introducing a vaccine to produce protection from a disease; immunization, which is synonymous with inoculation, is the process by which a person becomes protected against a disease through vaccination.   \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the concept of inoculation, which I completely support,\u201d she said in the December 2020 episode.   Karamo also suggested companies producing vaccines could not be trusted, adding that \u201cthe issue is that these vaccines have a bunch of additives and ingredients in there and they do a bunch of combo shots and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s in these shots they\u2019re giving us. It\u2019s just like, \u2018Take it, shut up. Don\u2019t ask questions.\u2019\u201d   In addition, Karamo relayed a story about a woman who claimed a vaccine caused her son\u2019s autism and said that autism was skyrocketing due to vaccine use. The idea that vaccines can cause autism has repeatedly been debunked by scientific studies.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

In another, he said his mother, whose family has lived in Brazil since the late 1800s, was a White immigrant from Belgium.   Santos\u2019 campaign did not respond to CNN\u2019s comment request.   Since reports first surfaced about his false claims, Santos has made efforts to downplay his fabrications as mere \u201cembellishments.\u201d But the previously unreported claims from Santos illustrate a pattern of fabricating details about his life, often in service of presenting a more compelling or interesting personal narrative. The Nassau County district attorney\u2019s office said Wednesday that it is looking into Santos\u2019 fabrications, though it did not specify the falsehoods it would explore.   In interviews over the past few days, Santos admitted to lying about parts of his resume, including graduating from college, but he told the New York Post that the misrepresentation of his work history at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup was a \u201cpoor choice of words.\u201d There is no record he worked at the top financial institutions in the country, as he had previously claimed.   Santos also denied that he falsely called himself Jewish, claiming he \u201cnever claimed to be Jewish\u201d but jokingly said he was \u201cJew-ish\u201d to the New York Post. He also falsely claimed that his grandparents \u201csurvived the Holocaust\u201d and fled Europe to escape Jewish persecution. But CNN found that Santos called himself an \u201cAmerican Jew\u201d and \u201cLatino Jew\u201d on multiple occasions. The Republican Jewish Coalition disinvited Santos from appearing at any of its events because he \u201cmisrepresented his heritage.\u201d   Despite the scandals, the New York Republican, who flipped his Long Island seat, said he will take office in January \u2014 spurring calls to resign from Democrats.   Here are some of the outright falsehoods CNN found:   In appearances, and in an old campaign biography, Santos claimed his parents sent him to Horace Mann, an elite private school in the Bronx.   \u201cHe began Horace Mann preparatory school in the Bronx, however, did not graduate from Horace Mann due to financial difficulties for his family,\u201d his biography read in 2019 for his first campaign for Congress that Santos lost. \u201cHe obtained a GED during his senior year.\u201d   Santos also made the same claim in an appearance on a YouTube show in 2020.   \u201cThey sent me to a good prep school, which was Horace Mann Prep in the Bronx. And, in my senior year of prep school, unfortunately my parents fell on hard times, which was something that would later become known as the depression of 2008. But we were hit a little earlier on with the overleveraging of real estate. And the market started to implode. Um, and the first thing to go was the prep school. You know, you, you can\u2019t afford a $2,500 tuition at that point, right? So anyway, um, I left school, uh, four months to graduation.\u201d   But the claim is false, according to the school.   \u201cWe\u2019ve searched the records and there is no evidence that George Santos (or any alias) attended Horace Mann,\u201d Ed Adler, a spokesman for the school, told CNN.   \u201cHave you ever heard of a Goldman Sachs employee take the stage at the largest private equity conference in the world \u2013 SALT, run by Anthony Scaramucci \u2013 and berate their employer? Well, I did that,\u201d Santos said on a local podcast this summer. \u201cAnd I did it in the fashion of renewable energy and global warming. This was the panel I was on. And they\u2019re all talking about solar, wind, and this was back, what, seven years ago now? And I said, you know what, this is a scam. It\u2019s taxpayer money that gets subsidized.\u201d   The claim is entirely fictional, according to both Goldman Sachs \u2013 which has said Santos never worked there \u2013 and Scaramucci, who runs the conference.   Scaramucci told CNN in a message there is not only no record of him appearing on a panel, but no record of him even attending the conference.   In an appearance on a Fox News digital show in February, Santos said his maternal grandparents changed their Jewish last name from Zabrovsky \u2013 a claim for which there is no evidence and records contradict.   \u201cWe don\u2019t carry the Ukrainian last name. For a lot of people who are descendants of World War II refugees or survivors of the Holocaust, a lot of names and paperwork were changed in the name of survival. So I don\u2019t carry the family last name that would\u2019ve been Zabrovsky. I carry my mother\u2019s maiden name which is the Dutch side of the family.\u201d   Megan Smolenyak, an author and professional genealogist who helped research Santos\u2019 family tree at CNN\u2019s request, previously told CNN, \u201cThere\u2019s no sign of Jewish and/or Ukrainian heritage and no indication of name changes along the way.\u201d   Santos deleted his former private Facebook account last week, but CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed records indicating he used the alias of \u201cAnthony Zabrovsky\u201d for fundraising for a pet charity. The GoFundMe page under that alias no longer exists. CNN reached out to GoFundMe but did not receive a response.   In one radio appearance from December 2020, Santos falsely claimed that his mother \u201cfled socialism\u201d in Europe and moved to the United States.   \u201cMy father fled socialism in Brazil. My mother fled socialism in Europe, and they came here and built a family. And today they can be proud to have a son who is a well accomplished businessman, who is now running for United States Congress. That\u2019s something that wasn\u2019t in the cards for my family,\u201d Santos said.   He also claimed in another interview from 2020 that he \u201cgrew up with a White Caucasian mother, an immigrant from Belgium.\u201d   But Santos\u2019 mother was born in Brazil, according to genealogical records.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

George Santos that his grandparents \u201csurvived the Holocaust\u201d as Ukrainian Jewish refugees from Belgium who changed their surname to survive are contradicted by sources reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile including family trees compiled by genealogy websites, records on Jewish refugees and interviews with multiple genealogists.   Santos, who has called himself \u201chalf Jewish\u201d and a \u201cLatino Jew\u201d in media appearances, has claimed his maternal grandfather was originally from Ukraine and fled to Brazil to escape Nazism. In another telling, the New York Republican said his grandparents converted to Catholicism during the rise of Nazism in Belgium after fleeing Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union. In another telling, he claimed his family changed their name to survive Nazism.   CNN spoke to multiple genealogists who said there was no proof of the claims. Santos\u2019 misrepresentations of his family history were first reported by The Forward on Wednesday. Records from the Holocaust Museum and the International Center on Nazi Persecution, which contain records on Jewish refugees, also show no mention of Santos\u2019 grandparents.   Megan Smolenyak, an author and professional genealogist who helped research Santos\u2019 family tree at CNN\u2019s request, said in email, \u201cThere\u2019s no sign of Jewish and/or Ukrainian heritage and no indication of name changes along the way.\u201d   The incoming Republican lawmaker has faced scrutiny over his resume since The New York Times revealed on Monday that Santos\u2019 biography appeared to be partly fictional. CNN confirmed details of The New York Times reporting on Monday, including that he may have misrepresented parts of his resume about his college education and employment history.   A lawyer for Santos declined to comment to CNN.   \u201cI\u2019m very proud of my Jewish heritage,\u201d Santos said in an appearance from late November 2022 with the Jewish News Syndicate. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of my grandparents\u2019 story. My grandfather fleeing, Ukraine, fleeing Stalin\u2019s persecution, going to Belgium, finding refuge there, marrying my grandmother, then fleeing Hitler going to Brazil. That\u2019s a story of perseverance. I\u2019m so proud. I mean, I wish I could have met my grandfather.\u201d   In another interview from earlier this year, Santos claimed that his grandparents survived the Holocaust.   \u201cMy grandparents survived the Holocaust, so these regimes of socialism, Marxism, they don\u2019t work, and they\u2019re followed up by a lot of hurt, and we\u2019re seeing that currently and what\u2019s happening in Ukraine with the Russians,\u201d Santos said in a May 2022 interview.   But family histories from the websites MyHeritage and Geneanet and a Dutch periodical from the town the family emigrated from show his maternal grandparents, Paolo and Rosalina Devolder, were both born in Brazil. Records on FamilySearch, first reported by The Forward, also show Santos\u2019 great-grandfather as living in Brazil.   While it is possible that his maternal grandparents returned to Europe and then moved back to Brazil, there is no evidence to support this. And there is no evidence that the family were Jewish refugees fleeing Europe.   Additionally, Santos\u2019 ties to Ukraine were only added to his campaign biography sometime between April 2022 and October 2022, according to the Internet Archive\u2019s WayBack Machine. His bio now begins: \u201cGeorge\u2019s grandparents fled Jewish persecution in Ukraine, settled in Belgium, and again fled persecution during WWII.\u201d   When the Ukraine-Russia conflict began in February 2022, Santos told Fox News digital that his ties to Ukraine were \u201cvery vague\u201d and said it would be \u201cdisingenuous\u201d to claim his relatives were at risk. But he added that his family later changed their surname to survive.   \u201cIt\u2019s just very vague and faint,\u201d said Santos\u2019 of his ties to the country. \u201cWe don\u2019t carry the Ukrainian last name. For a lot of people who are descendants of World War II refugees or survivors of the Holocaust, a lot of names and paperwork were changed in name of survival.\u201d   But records dispute this assertion. The Devolder surname has been used by his mother\u2019s family for generations, and the family has not changed it, according to family trees reviewed by the genealogists CNN spoke to.   Santos\u2019 mother died in 2016, but her Facebook posts include Catholic prayers and posts about the Virgin Mary on Easter with no posts indicating Jewish heritage.   In a different appearance, Santos said his mother\u2019s grandfather\u2019s family converted to Catholicism during the rise of Nazism, though he specified he was not trying to claim to Jewish heritage.   \u201cMy grandfather grew up Jewish. My grandfather, during the Soviet issues, escaped to Belgium,\u201d said Santos. \u201cAnd then that was a great move. Met my grandmother, married, and crazy enough, the Nazis became a thing. And that\u2019s when he said, \u2018Oh my God, this is all over again.\u2019 They converted to Catholicism, had their kids, raised them Catholic. And I\u2019m Catholic, but that\u2019s pretty much little history of my family into Judaism.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The company said in the email that it was \u201creevaluating how best to bring external insights into our product and policy development work.

An online posting with antisemitic comments in a forum frequented by extremists prompted an FBI alert Thursday night, CNN reported.   Authorities were alarmed because the posting was written as if an attack had already occurred, the sources explained. Similar writings have been posted by \u201cactive shooters\u201d in incidents across the country just before their attacks.   That factored significantly into the urgency of locating him and also releasing the broad warning to the Jewish community, the sources said.   The online threat arrived at a moment of rising antisemitism in the US, as public incidents of bigotry have surfaced around the nation, from Florida to California.   \u201cEach and every law enforcement agency in New Jersey stood up yesterday to protect and communicate with our Jewish neighbors against hate,\u201d New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement Friday. \u201cFrom direct contact to synagogue leadership, to uniformed and non-uniformed police presences at places of worship, our State Police, federal partners, county prosecutor\u2019s officers, local police departments, sheriffs and other law enforcement moved swiftly to protect synagogues and Jewish centers.\u201d   \u201cWhile this immediate threat has been mitigated, we know that others may follow and we know that hate continues to fester,\u201d the attorney general added.   It\u2019s unclear at this time what, if any, charges the individual connected to the New Jersey synagogues threat will face.   CNN has contacted the FBI for comment.   On Thursday, the FBI in Newark tweeted it had received \u201ccredible information of a broad threat to synagogues\u201d in the state.   \u201cWe ask at this time that you take all security precautions to protect your community and facility. We will share more information as soon as we can. Stay alert. In case of emergency call police,\u201d the post said.   In a second tweet, the agency said it was taking a \u201cproactive measure\u201d with that warning, while \u201cinvestigative processes are carried out.\u201d   While no specific target, timing or plan was mentioned, the nature of the post created enough concern that the FBI decided to put a general warning out of an abundance of caution, the law enforcement sources said.   Part of that concern, the sources added, comes because of previous mass killings involving extremists who posted on social media, including the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue killings, the deadliest attack on Jewish people on US soil; the 2019 mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, the deadliest attack on Latinos in modern US history; and the May massacre at a Buffalo supermarket, an attack which officials said was racially motivated.   Thursday evening, the FBI said it takes all threats seriously and was working with law enforcement to investigate the threat and was also \u201cengaged with our faith based partners in the affected community.\u201d   Related article As antisemitism grows, so does its dangers to everyone. Here's how you can fight against it   New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday, \u201cThis remains a tense time for our Jewish communities who are facing a wave of anti-Semitic activity.\u201d   Murphy said he was grateful to the FBI and other law enforcement partners \u201cfor their tireless efforts in mitigating the immediate threat to our Jewish synagogues.\u201d   \u201cWe will remain vigilant. We will take any and every threat with the utmost seriousness and we will stand up and stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish congregations.\u201d   The president of a company that provides security for hundreds of Jewish houses of worship and schools in the New Jersey and New York area has sent out guidance to clients to ask for additional security from law enforcement, he told CNN.   Synagogues should contact local law enforcement and \u201crequest not just increased patrols but actual manpower during prayers and other activities,\u201d said Joshua Gleis, of Gleis Security Consulting.   Gleis also advised synagogues not to conduct outdoor activities until further notice and to pull down exterior shades.   He also advised Jewish schools in the area to take similar actions until more information is available, as \u201cany credible threat to a Jewish synagogue can become one to a Jewish school or community center.\u201d   The NYPD also said Thursday its Intelligence and Counterterrorism Bureaus were working with the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the FBI to \u201censure the safety and well-being of every area that encompasses our Jewish citizens and synagogues here in New York City and the tri-state area.\u201d   Over the past few years, the US has seen a rise in antisemitic incidents, with 941 incidents in 2015 jumping to 2,717 tracked in 2021 by the Anti-Defamation League. On Thursday, the ADL said it was working with the FBI to address the credible threat and advised synagogues and Jewish organizations to \u201cremain calm and in heightened state of alert.\u201d   Related article As Tree of Life massacre anniversary nears, recent antisemitic rhetoric proves too many Americans learned nothing from attack   The FBI\u2019s warning on Thursday comes amid continued reports across the country of anti-Jewish bigotry, including multiple antisemitic messages that appeared in public spaces in Jacksonville, Florida, over the weekend, and a group of demonstrators who hung banners over a Los Angeles freeway earlier in October showing support for antisemitic comments that were made by Kanye West. Photos also showed the group with their arms raised in what appeared to be the Nazi salute. Los Angeles officials condemned the incident.   West previously made a series of antisemitic outbursts, notably on October 8, when he tweeted he was \u201cgoing death con 3 [sic] On JEWISH PEOPLE,\u201d and also that, \u201cYou guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda,\u201d without specifying what group he was addressing, according to the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine records pulled by CNN.

Some senior Senate Republicans have expressed concerns that Walker\u2019s past words and actions threaten his chances to beat incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock. But Walker was urged to run by former President Donald Trump.   In addition to a longtime personal relationship with Trump, Walker has a quality Trump prizes in 2022 candidates: a willingness to say false things about the 2020 presidential election Trump lost.   Walker is not the only candidate for the Republican Senate nomination in Georgia to question the legitimacy of the 2020 results. But Walker has been particularly prolific and specific in his election-related dishonesty \u2013 and he has by far the biggest megaphone. Walker has uttered false conspiracy theories on both Fox News and on Twitter, where he has more than 445,000 followers.   And his dishonesty has not been limited to the subject of the election. Walker has also promoted false conspiracy theories about the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and about Democrats.   Walker\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment for this article.   A false claim about Biden votes   During a Fox News appearance in December, Walker said, \u201cI can guarantee you, Joe Biden didn\u2019t get 50 million people voting for him. But yet people think that he\u2019s won this election.\u201d   Biden did win the election \u2013 with more than 81 million votes.   False claims of mass fraud   In a tweet on January 4, two days before Congress met to count the 2020 electoral votes, Walker falsely alleged that there was \u201cCountry wide election fraud.\u201d Walker called for Trump and \u201cTRUE PATRIOTS\u201d to conduct a \u201ctotal cleansing\u201d \u2013 he didn\u2019t explain what he meant \u2013 and continued, \u201cLet\u2019s get back to real Law & Order and prosecute all the bad actors. Whatever it takes to get the job done.\u201d   Even senior officials from the Trump administration have acknowledged that there was no widespread or outcome-changing fraud in the 2020 election. But Walker repeatedly said or suggested that fraud was pervasive and that unspecified people had manipulated the election.   In a tweet on November 6, three days after Election Day, Walker wrote, \u201cTo be the man, you gotta beat the man, not CHEAT the man.\u201d In a tweet on January 6, after the Capitol was attacked by pro-Trump rioters, Walker said he wanted Trump to get to the bottom of \u201cwho stole this election.\u201d   Walker said on Twitter in December that Georgia should refuse to certify Biden\u2019s victory there because of \u201cserious Election Fraud,\u201d asking in a video \u201chow can we certify something that we know is not right.\u201d In another tweet in November, Walker wrote that \u201cpeople playing with this election need to be punished for breaking the law.\u201d   A baseless call for a re-vote   In an additional November 6 tweet, Walker baselessly suggested that the results of the voting in seven key states, including six won by Biden, were undemocratic. He proposed that the country toss out all of the votes in these states.   \u201cInstead of us fighting and going to court, why don\u2019t we have Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin vote again? We can have it done within a week, and maintain our democracy,\u201d he wrote.   A conspiracy theory about altered votes   On November 8, Walker tweeted, \u201cAnyone using HAMMER SCORECARD to alter voting in our America election should be prosecuted.\u201d   Nobody used anything called \u201cHAMMER SCORECARD\u201d to alter votes in the election. This is an entirely baseless conspiracy theory \u2013 about supposed vote-stealing software created by US intelligence \u2013 whose origins have been linked to a man with a history of false claims.   A Trump-appointed top cybersecurity official, Chris Krebs, called Hammer and Scorecard claims \u201ca hoax,\u201d \u201cnonsense,\u201d and \u201cnot a real thing\u201d in the days before Walker\u2019s tweet. (Trump fired Krebs less than two weeks later over his public debunkings of false fraud claims.)   The Dominion conspiracy theory and Sidney Powell   In late November, Walker tweeted that if pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell was correct \u201cabout some of our Elected Officials knowing about Dominion yet did nothing and said nothing..they need to resign their positions and never run for another office in the US and maybe some end up in jail. Our Democracy is at stake!\u201d   Conspiracy theories about the voting technology company Dominion Voting Systems had already been widely debunked at the time. Dominion has filed defamation suits against Powell and others who promoted false claims about the company.   The day after this Walker tweet, the Trump campaign disavowed Powell, who had been widely mocked for making especially outlandish conspiratorial claims about the election. But Walker was undeterred. He tweeted, \u201cI still have a lot of faith in Sidney Powell.\u201d Later that day, Walker tweeted, \u201cAll you Doubters will be shocked when @SidneyPowell1 lays the SMACKDOWN on many of the people you have trusted for years!\u201d   A false claim about Georgia ballots   In December, Walker tweeted a photo of an Georgia absentee ballot application and a photo of an envelope that was addressed to someone at a county jail in the state. He wrote, \u201cSo now we find GA mailed ballots to prisons?\u201d He asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger \u201chow much stuff has to be exposed before investigations.\u201d   Walker was wrong; nothing had been \u201cexposed\u201d here.   First: Unlike absentee ballots themselves, Georgia ballot applications can be printed out by anybody, not just election officials, and mailed to anyone else. This application was mailed by an independent group, not by Raffensperger.   Second: There is nothing inherently wrong with someone in a county jail being sent a ballot application or even a ballot itself. Only people serving felony sentences are ineligible to vote in Georgia. People convicted of misdemeanors or awaiting felony trials \u2013 in other words, the kinds of people who are often incarcerated in county jails \u2013 are allowed to vote.   A conspiracy theory about why the Capitol riot happened   On the afternoon of January 6, Walker tweeted a false suggestion that the Capitol riot was orchestrated by people who wanted to stop the discussion about election fraud.   \u201cHave you noticed were not talking about election fraud and election integrity now? Seems like this was well planned to shut everything down and run the clock out,\u201d Walker wrote.   Nonsense. The riot was perpetrated by Trump supporters, not by people looking to silence Trump supporters. The Department of Justice has charged more than 575 people so far.   A conspiracy theory about participants in the riot   In another tweet on January 6, Walker posted a Capitol photo that featured rioters including distinctively dressed \u201cQAnon shaman\u201d Jacob Chansley. Walker falsely suggested that these people weren\u2019t actually Trump supporters \u2013 calling them \u201cTrojan horses\u201d and saying \u201cthey do not look like MAGA.\u201d   Walker also posted an image that zoomed in on the tattoo on the hand of a man standing beside Chansley in the first photo, William Watson. Some others on the right had claimed that the tattoo was of a communist hammer and sickle symbol.   In fact, both Chansley and Watson were Trump supporters. And as the website Alabama Political Reporter noted, Watson proceeded to personally debunk false theories about both his motivations and the tattoo \u2013 explaining on Snapchat that the tattoo is a symbol from a video game (called Dishonored).   A conspiracy theory about Black Lives Matter and Democrats   In a Twitter video in September, Walker tried to push a confusing and baseless conspiracy theory about money being sent from the Chinese government to Black Lives Matter and then \u201cto the Democratic Party.\u201d   \u201cWhy does it seem like I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s coming up with this?\u201d Walker said in the video, which was noted in March by the conservative website The Bulwark.   Perhaps because the theory doesn\u2019t make sense. Walker\u2019s claim relied on a fundamental misunderstanding of ActBlue \u2013 an online fundraising platform for a wide variety of Democratic candidates and progressive entities \u2013 and, if we were understanding him correctly, a false claim that a Chinese-American group in California is a \u201ccompany from China.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Here is a look at the facts, as we know them today, around five of the public arguments Trump and his team have made in the wake of the search.   The Justice Department said in a court filing this week that the search of Mar-a-Lago resulted in the seizure of more than 100 unique documents with classification markings. But in posts on his social media platform, Trump has argued that he had declassified all of the documents in his possession.   \u201cNumber one, it was all declassified,\u201d he wrote in a post on August 12. \u201cLucky I Declassified!\u201d he wrote in a post this Wednesday.   Trump\u2019s comments about this supposed declassification have been very vague. But conservative writer John Solomon, one of the people Trump named as a representative in his dealings with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), was more specific in a Fox appearance on August 12. Solomon read a statement, which he said was from Trump\u2019s office, claiming that Trump \u201chad a standing order\u2026that documents removed from the Oval Office and taken to the residence were deemed to be declassified the moment he removed them.\u201d   Facts First: Trump and his team have not provided any proof that Trump actually conducted some sort of broad declassification of the documents that ended up at Mar-a-Lago \u2013 and, so far, his lawyers notably have not argued in their court filings that Trump did so. Eighteen former top Trump administration officials, including two former White House chiefs of staff who spoke on the record, told CNN in August that they never heard of a standing Trump declassification order when they were serving in the administration and that they now believe the claim is false. The former officials used words like \u201cludicrous,\u201d \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cbullsh*t.\u201d   Related article What to watch for at Thursday's hearing in Trump's bid for a special master over documents seized at Mar-a-Lago   \u201cTotal nonsense,\u201d said one person who served as a senior White House official. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, where is the order with his signature on it? If that were the case, there would have been tremendous pushback from the Intel Community and DoD, which would almost certainly have become known to Intel and Armed Services Committees on the Hill.\u201d   It\u2019s important to note that the laws under which the Justice Department is now investigating possible crimes \u2013 statutes about the willful retention of national defense information, obstruction of a federal investigation, and the concealment or removal of government records \u2013 do not require documents to be classified for a crime to have been committed. (A grand jury subpoena in May and the search warrant in August both sought documents with \u201cclassification markings,\u201d not specifically documents that are currently classified.) Also, there would be major questions about the legal validity of any broad \u201cstanding order\u201d to automatically declassify any document Trump carried out of a certain room.   But first things first: Trump has shown no corroboration for the claim that he did issue such an order.   The Justice Department said in the court filing this week that Trump\u2019s representatives never asserted that documents had been declassified either when they voluntarily turned over 15 boxes that included 184 unique documents with classification markings in January (after an extended back-and-forth with NARA) or when responding to the grand jury subpoena in June, when they returned another package of documents that included 38 additional unique documents with classification markings.   \u2013 CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel, Elizabeth Stuart and Jeremy Herb contributed to this item.   Related article Trump's legal gambits offer fresh revelations and deepen his political risk   Trump has argued that the search was unnecessary because the federal investigators could have simply asked for the documents from his team, which he claimed had been fully cooperative.   \u201cThey could have had it anytime they wanted\u2014and that includes LONG ago. ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS ASK,\u201d Trump posted on his social media platform on August 12.   Facts First: It is not true that federal investigators could have long ago obtained the government records in Trump\u2019s possession just by asking. By the time of the search, the federal government had been asking Trump for more than a year to return records from his presidency. Even when the Justice Department went beyond asking in May and served Trump\u2019s team with the subpoena for the return of all documents with classification markings, Trump\u2019s team returned only some of these documents \u2013 and then, in June, Trump lawyer Christina Bobb signed a document certifying on behalf of Trump\u2019s office that all of the documents had been returned, though that was not true.   In other words: Trump claimed that the Justice Department could have just asked for the documents \u201cLONG ago\u201d even though his team explicitly and inaccurately told the department in June that there were no documents left to ask for. Relatedly, the department has called into question how cooperative Trump\u2019s team was.   In its court filing this week, the department asserted that investigators \u201cdeveloped evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room\u201d at Mar-a-Lago \u201cand that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government\u2019s investigation.\u201d They said of the August search: \u201cThat the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the \u2018diligent search\u2019 that the former President\u2019s counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter.\u201d   A member of Trump\u2019s team has tried to pin blame on the General Services Administration, a federal agency that provides transition office space and assistance services to the outgoing president.   Related article The case against Trump is starting to come into focus. Here's what we know   Kash Patel, a former Trump administration official whom Trump named as another representative to NARA, said on Fox on August 12 on that \u201cthe GSA has since come out, the Government (sic) Services Administration, and said they mistakenly packed some boxes and moved them to Mar-a-Lago. That\u2019s not on the President. That\u2019s on the National Archives to sort that material out.\u201d Patel said that even if material was classified, which is \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d the fact that the GSA boxed the material \u201cshould have been the end\u201d of the matter.   Facts First: The GSA has repeatedly rejected Patel\u2019s claim. The agency says it had no role in deciding which documents from Trump\u2019s outgoing transition office in Virginia would be placed in boxes or which boxes would be shipped to Mar-a-Lago \u2013 and that these decisions were made by Trump\u2019s team alone.   A GSA spokesperson said in a statement last week that it was Trump\u2019s team, not the GSA, that packed the boxes and that it was Trump\u2019s team, not the GSA, that put these boxes on pallets and shrink-wrapped them for shipping from Trump\u2019s transition office in Virginia. GSA did enter into a support contract for the actual September 2021 shipping, but \u201cnot for the packing of the boxes,\u201d the spokesperson said \u2013 and \u201cGSA did not examine the contents of the boxes and, accordingly, had no knowledge of the contents prior to shipping.\u201d   It is not clear how many of the government documents recovered at Mar-a-Lago were part of the September 2021 shipments from Virginia. It is theoretically possible that some documents were taken to Mar-a-Lago at other times and in other ways.   - CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes contributed to this item.   Trump lawyer Alina Habba said on Fox on August 9: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that they may have planted something; you know, at this point, who knows?\u201d The next day, Trump suggested on social media that it was shady that the FBI would not allow witnesses, such as his lawyers, to be in the rooms being searched and \u201csee what they were doing, taking or, hopefully not, \u2018planting.\u2019\u201d   Related article Dissecting 7 key pieces of the Mar-a-Lago photo   Facts First: There is zero evidence that the FBI planted anything at Mar-a-Lago. And it is routine, not suspicious, for searches to be conducted without witnesses such as lawyers being in the room; lawyers don\u2019t have a right to watch.   The claim about possible \u201cplanting\u201d is impossible to definitively debunk at this point. Once more, though, Trump and his allies have not shown even a hint of proof that it is true.   The week of the search, Trump turned to a familiar tactic under pressure: confuse the public by making false claims about former President Barack Obama. Trump asserted that Obama had taken tens of millions of documents to Chicago, Obama\u2019s adopted hometown and the location of his future library and museum.   Related article Trump weighs delaying 2024 decision as political and legal troubles grow   In a social media post on August 11, Trump wrote, \u201cWhat happened to the 30 million pages of documents taken from the White House to Chicago by Barack Hussein Obama? He refused to give them back! What is going on? This act was strongly at odds with NARA. Will they be breaking into Obama\u2019s \u2018mansion\u2019 in Martha\u2019s Vineyard?\u201d In another statement on August 12, Trump claimed: \u201cPresident Barack Hussein Obama kept 33 million pages of documents, much of them classified.\u201d   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims about Obama are comprehensively untrue \u2013 and the National Archives and Records Administration issued an official statement making that clear. The statement explained that all of Obama\u2019s presidential records remain in NARA\u2019s \u201cexclusive legal and physical custody\u201d; that it was NARA, not Obama, that took about 30 million records to a NARA facility in the Chicago area; that the records it took to the Chicago-area facility are unclassified; and that classified Obama records are at a different NARA facility.   NARA has more information here about the plan for Obama\u2019s presidential records.   CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen contributed to this article.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

A review of Masters\u2019 website by CNN\u2019s KFile showed he also removed controversial language saying Democrats were trying to \u201cimport\u201d a new electorate \u2013 language that has drawn fire for mirroring far-right conspiracies that Democrats are trying to weaken the power of native-born Americans of European descent through mass immigration of non-White immigrants.

Mark Kelly in the closely watched Senate race. The sections were gone by August 26, according to screenshots from the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine.   Masters\u2019s new campaign posturing comes as a flurry of Republican candidates nationwide attempt to distance themselves from unpopular or divisive policy positions, particularly about abortion and the legitimacy of the 2020 election, ahead of the midterm election this November.   NBC News first reported last week that Masters attempted to tone down his position on abortion by removing from his website his support of a \u201cfederal personhood law\u201d and a several other strict anti-abortion positions while releasing a video in which the Republican nominee took a softer stance on the issue.   Related video Election deniers take over CPAC after primary victories   A person close to Masters told CNN last week that the Republican candidate designs, codes and updates his website himself \u2013 and that his recent updates to the abortion section reflect his desire to use his policy section as a \u201cliving document\u201d rather than an immutable record of his positions.   It\u2019s unusual for candidates to update their issues pages on major issues, and CNN has reached out to Masters\u2019 campaign about the modified language about the 2020 election.   In early August, the page \u201cThe Masters Plan,\u201d read, \u201cWe need to get serious about election integrity.

They canceled the Border Wall construction. They invite illegals to come here and give them housing and cash. The Democrats dream of mass amnesty, because they want to import a new electorate.\u201d   Masters removed the last line, which nods to the great replacement conspiracy theory.   Masters\u2019 website was removed from the Web Archive temporarily at his request, according to a spokesperson for the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine.   Any person can request their content be removed from the Wayback Machine and Internet users flagged its removal on Friday following NBC\u2019s report.

Michael Peroutka, a candidate best known for his ties to neo-Confederate organizations, made the remarks on The American View, a radio show he co-hosted, in October 2006 while discussing the fifth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack.   \u201cWhat happened on 9-1-1, I told you that I had been doing some research and watching some videos,\u201d Peroutka said during one of the episodes reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cAnd I said that if the buildings in New York City, the World Trade Center buildings, came down by demolition charges \u2013 that is to say \u2013 if there was this evidence that there was that something was preset there, then the implications of that are massive,\u201d said Peroutka.   \u201cI\u2019ve been doing some reading and doing some studying, and I believe that to be very, very true,\u201d he added, before further suggesting the work was done by controlled explosives.   \u201cThe other thing that just is so striking to me, I can\u2019t get it out of my brain, and that is the vision of Building 7 falling faster than the speed of gravity, right? Building 7, which no plane hit,\u201d said Peroutka. \u201cAnd all of a sudden Building 7 falls, very consistent with what they call controlled demolitions or controlled charges because that building from the top down falls faster than if you had thrown a hammer off the top of the building.\u201d   Peroutka\u2019s comments echo the widely debunked conspiracy theory that the Twin Towers and 7 World Trade Center, the smaller building within the vicinity of the towers, were wired with explosives and detonated in a series of controlled demolitions.   The Twin Towers collapsed after terrorist-hijacked planes intentionally crashed into the North Tower and then the South Tower, killing 2,753 people. Nearby \u201cBuilding 7\u201d suffered intense and uncontrollable fires after debris from the North Tower hit the building, causing a chain reaction that led to the building\u2019s collapse, according to a study published in 2008 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.   Peroutka went even further with his conspiratorial logic, speculating that every building in New York City could have preset charges awaiting detonation by some \u201celite bureaucrat.\u201d   \u201cThat begs the question that if there are preset charges in Building Seven, what\u2019s to stop there for being preset charges in Buildings 1, 2 8, 9, and 27?\u201d said Peroutka. \u201cAre there charges in every building in New York City? Is everyone ready to be brought down whenever some elite bureaucrat decides that he\u2019s gonna pull it?\u201d   Peroutka also called the 9/11 terrorist attacks an \u201cinside job,\u201d saying \u201cyou can\u2019t have an explosion in the basement that\u2019s done by the hijacker on the airplane\u201d and claimed that the official account of the 9/11 attack was the real \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d   The campaign did not address Peroutka\u2019s previous conspiracy theories when asked for comment, but Macky Stafford, Petroutka\u2019s campaign coordinator, told CNN in a statement that the \u201cprimary election results demonstrate that Maryland Republicans are dissatisfied with their current leadership.\u201d   But outgoing Maryland GOP Gov. Larry Hogan called out Peroutka on Sunday, saying, \u201cThese disgusting lies don\u2019t belong in our party.\u201d   \u201cWe know who was responsible for 9/11. Blaming our country for Al-Qaeda\u2019s atrocities is an insult to the memory of the thousands of innocent Americans and brave first responders who died that day,\u201d Hogan tweeted.   Peroutka previously ran for president in 2004 as the nominee of the Constitution Party. During that campaign, Peroutka posted on his website an endorsement from the League of the South \u2013 a new-Confederate organization that advocates southern secession. The homepage for his campaign prominently featured a Confederate flag linking to \u201cSoutherners for Peroutka\u201d whose homepage had a large Confederate flag displayed over the Capitol saying, \u201cWe have a dream.\u201d He also promoted his candidacy to the Council of Conservative Citizens, according to copies of their newsletter obtained by CNN. The CCC is a self-described White-rights group that opposes non-White immigration and advances White nationalist ideology.   Peroutka will face Democratic Rep. Anthony Brown in the general election this November. If elected, Brown would be the first Black attorney general in the state. Maryland has not had a Republican attorney general since 1952, when one was appointed; the last Republican attorney general elected in the state was in 1919.   In other episodes of Peroutka\u2019s radio show reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile, Peroutka also cast doubt that the Pentagon was hit by American Airlines Flight 77, asking where the video is showing this \u201cincoming attack, plane or missile,\u201d later saying that it is \u201cvery plausible that a missile that looked like a plane hit the Pentagon.\u201d   Peroutka even questioned if remains of the deceased were found at the Pentagon, suggesting they were killed elsewhere. He said he had seen \u201cno evidence\u201d of any bodies or luggage to his late co-host and former presidential campaign adviser, John Lofton.   Lofton said, \u201cAh, but see the missile thing. Then you gotta count for the remains and the body parts and show how all those people got inside the missile. How all those passengers\u2013\u201d   \u201cI saw the pictures. There was, there was nothing that looked like a body or luggage or anything in there,\u201d Peroutka interrupted. \u201cAnd the pictures that I saw \u2013 if there are pictures, John \u2013 that show body parts or luggage or even a seat of an airplane that\u2019s consistent with Flight 77, that particular airplane. If there\u2019s anything that\u2019s consistent with that, I haven\u2019t seen a picture of it.\u201d   Shortly after, Lofton said, \u201cIf I can produce for you a person who was a friend or loved one of one of the passengers that perished on that plane that hit the Pentagon, that says, \u2018Yes, we got remains back from our loved one or friend.\u2019 Will that impress you?\u201d   \u201cNo, absolutely not,\u201d replied Peroutka. \u201cWhere did the remains come from? I\u2019m not disputing that the people died.\u201d   \u201cUnless a plane hit the Pentagon, how would the remains of anybody on that flight get into the Pentagon?\u201d asked Lofton.   \u201cI didn\u2019t say they got into the Pentagon. I couldn\u2019t see them in the Pentagon. There wasn\u2019t any \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen any evidence that anything like a body or a passenger or passenger\u2019s luggage or anything that\u2019s consistent with the Flight 77 is in the Pentagon. If there are such pictures, I\u2019d like to see them. Now, you could clearly understand that somebody whose loved one was lost on that plane, very possibly, could have gotten some piece of forensic evidence that indicated that their loved one was in fact deceased. But who says that came from the Pentagon?\u201d   Peroutka then said this was the first time he had heard that the remains of the deceased were found at the Pentagon.   American Airlines Flight 77 was hijacked by five terrorists on September 11, 2001, and deliberately crashed into the Pentagon, killing all 64 people aboard and another 125 people in the building.

Courtney Holland, a Nevada-based political activist who does not appear to have entered the Capitol building herself and has not been charged with crimes related to January 6, was named Adam Laxalt\u2019s top spokeswoman in early July. Laxalt is running against Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and the race is considered a toss up.   Holland traveled to Washington, DC, for the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally where she was listed as a speaker for a rally to be held near the Capitol following then-President Donald Trump\u2019s speech near the White House. That second rally did not take place as scheduled. She had previously spoken at a November event in Washington, DC, and was photographed with several \u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizers who also spoke. The \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement believes Trump\u2019s lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him.   Early on the morning of January 6, Holland walked with a group to the main rally, which featured Trump, according to a video in a since-deleted tweet on her account archived on the Internet Wayback Machine. The group included three other speakers listed for the rally near the Capitol.   Following Trump\u2019s rally, Holland was part of a group that now-included four other scheduled speakers for the second rally that made their way toward the Capitol guided by three Oath Keepers, according to videos and photos reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile. Holland said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday that she did not know the men, describing them as \u201csecurity.\u201d Two of those Oath Keepers, Kenneth Harrelson and Jason Dolan, have since been charged by the Department of Justice for their role in the Capitol attack. Also walking with Holland was Dr. Simone Gold, an anti-vaccine doctor who pleaded guilty in March to entering the Capitol and was recently sentenced to 60 days in jail, and John Strand, a co-defendant in her case who has pleaded not guilty.   There is no indication Holland herself entered the Capitol. Pictures posted by amateur sleuths last year tracking Capitol rioters appear to show Holland in a restricted area in front of the Capitol. Holland later repeatedly downplayed the attack, retweeting false claims suggesting the riot was the work of the far-left group Antifa and a tweet calling the protest \u201cthe largest civil rights protest in history.\u201d   Holland told CNN in her Tuesday statement that she went to Washington expecting to attend a \u201cpeaceful gathering.\u201d She said she did not know the Oath Keepers who led her to the second \u201cStop the Steal\u201d event that was supposed to take place near the Capitol. Holland said she has never been subpoenaed, questioned, or accused of wrongdoing and called the riot \u201can unfortunate day in our country\u2019s history.\u201d   \u201cLike thousands of others I attended the event, with expectations of a peaceful gathering. Event organizers asked me and many others to speak at a permitted area behind the Capitol and provided us with what we were told was event security, who we did not know, to reach the area. Upon reaching the permitted area, I became aware that the situation was deteriorating and decided to leave the Capitol complex to return to my hotel. I intended to speak at a peaceful rally, similar to a previous event held in November. Once it became clear what was happening, I left,\u201d Holland said.   Videos on social media and YouTube show Holland marching to the Capitol with her hand on Harrelson\u2019s shoulder. The group appears to be led at points by an unidentified man in a blue blazer wearing an Oath Keepers sweatshirt. The group walked in a \u201cstack\u201d formation that the Department of Justice said the Oath Keepers used to move through crowds on January 6, 2021.   The FBI explained the Oath Keepers\u2019 use of stack formations in a criminal complaint against Harrelson, which does not reference Holland or her group\u2019s walk to the Capitol. \u201cOne defining feature of this formation is that members keep their hands on the backs or vests of the person in front of them to remain together while entering a room or weaving through a crowd,\u201d they wrote in the complaint, which includes a photo of a different group of Oath Keepers marching in that formation outside of the Capitol building. \u201cThe purpose of maintaining direct physical contact with one another is to efficiently communicate with one another, especially in crowded or noisy areas.\u201d   One video \u2013 from the amateur sleuth YouTube account \u201cHunting Insurrectionists,\u201d which was verified by CNN\u2019s KFile by watching the original videos \u2013 tracking their group\u2019s march to the Capitol shows Holland walking from behind with her hand on an Oath Keeper\u2019s shoulder that appears to be Harrelson as someone yells, \u201cmake a hole ladies and gentlemen,\u201d for their group to pass. Strand can also briefly be seen talking to Gold. Another  YouTube video shows Harrelson, Gold and Strand all marching together with Holland. Dolan appears at the front of the group as well.   Harrelson was charged by the Department of Justice for a number of actions related to breaking into the Capitol, and later he was also charged with sedition. Dolan was also charged by the Department of Justice with five counts related to the Capitol riot, but three of his charges were dropped as part of a plea agreement that included cooperation with the government. Dolan pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy and one count of obstruction of an official proceeding.   The documents outlining evidence against Dolan noted both Oath Keepers traveled to Washington together and were frequently together before and during the Capitol riot. It alleged both men brought weapons to the area that they left in Virginia. Dolan\u2019s indictment from the Department of Justice makes reference to his march from the event near the White House.   Numerous members of the Oath Keepers have been charged for their roles breaking into the Capitol building. Last week, the Justice Department released new details that alleged extensive planning by the Oath Keepers to prepare for violence in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, including lessons to conduct \u201chasty ambushes,\u201d a \u201cdeath list\u201d of Georgia election officials and attempts to acquire homemade firearms.   Holland\u2019s exact movements after getting to the Capitol are unclear.   The group appeared to have made it to the east side of the Capitol, where the second rally was supposed to take place. One video, released by the Department of Justice to news organizations in the case against Harrelson, shows a cell phone video shot by the Oath Keeper on the east side of the Capitol with several members of the stack formation together, including what seems to be Holland.   One video appears to show her on the northwest side of the Capitol building with several members of her group, but not the Oath Keepers. A video from a since-deleted tweet also shows her at the east side of the Capitol near where the video shot by Harrelson was taken.   Following the riot and aftermath, Holland said in since-deleted tweets she would still stand up for Trump.   \u201cLast time I checked the Constitution it said \u2018We the People\u2019 not \u2018We the Government,\u2019\u201d she said just after the attack, and added in another tweet, \u201cI\u2019m still not giving up on fighting for Trump.\u201d   A year later, Holland maintained on Instagram the riot was \u201cnot an insurrection.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Walker, the former football player turned businessman, and his technology company 34 Technologies in 2012 partnered with Momentis, a multi-level marketing subsidiary of Just Energy, to sell an online marketing service. Walker\u2019s partnership with the subsidiary and the online marketing service they sold does not appear to have been targeted by the states as they investigated parent company Just Energy\u2019s sales practices.   Before Walker and Momentis\u2019 partnership was publicized in 2012, Just Energy, at times doing business under their previous name US Energy Savings, was repeatedly targeted for enforcement action by attorneys general in New York and Illinois. The parent company\u2019s practices allegedly enticed potential customers into long term contacts falsely saying they would save them money, allegedly included the elderly and those with language barriers being put into contracts they did not understand.   Just Energy established Momentis in 2010 to sell its energy products and other services according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.   Walker and Momentis\u2019 relationship began in 2012, according to a CNN KFile review of his business record, when Momentis and Walker\u2019s company partnered on a product called M-Marketing Systems. The product, sold through Momentis, was billed as an online marketing service bundle for clients offering businesses website, social, and email services. Walker was featured heavily in the promotion of the product on the Momentis company\u2019s website and at a conference in 2012.   \u201cThis is a product that has the power to make a tangible difference in the business community,\u201d Walker said in a video hosted on the website on Momentis in 2012 and 2013. The video said Walker found the product \u201cwas so compelling\u201d that \u201che decided to buy into the company that was backing up the technology.\u201d   Walker spoke at a Momentis convention about M-Marketing Systems in 2012, where the CEO of Momentis Andy McWilliams described Walker as a \u201cpartner\u201d in the company.   \u201cWe obviously want you to know that Herschel is not just somebody we brought up on stage,\u201d McWilliams said. \u201cHe is a partner in Momentis.\u201d   Though much of Walker\u2019s business record \u2013 and lawsuits and false claims around it \u2013 have been widely covered, his ties to Just Energy have not been scrutinized.   Walker\u2019s campaign did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment.   In 2014, the Massachusetts attorney general\u2019s office alleged that the multi-level marketing practices pushed by Just Energy and Momentis\u2019 salespeople falsely represented or misled customers about Just Energy\u2019s products, including that the products would save customers money, were offered through a state-run program and that the company made special efforts to purchase state-based renewable energy.   The state of Massachusetts and Just Energy and Momentis agreed to enter into an \u201cassurance of discontinuance\u201d action \u2014 a legal agreement between the attorney general\u2019s office and another party to resolve the alleged unlawful practice without litigation \u2014 against Just Energy. Just Energy denied all wrongdoing but agreed to pay $4,000,000, most of it going to consumers. Neither Walker nor 34 Technologies were named alongside Momentis in that action.   The parent company Just Energy\u2019s practices also resulted in settlements and payments to a state watchdog group in Illinois in 2006 and state regulators in Ohio in 2010 and 2016. Just Energy settled all of them by agreeing to pay large fines and restitution and promising to change their sales tactics. Momentis was not implicated in wrongdoing in those cases and was not a party to those settlements.   Just Energy filed for bankruptcy in March 2021 after the Texas energy crisis left millions without power and losses for the company. A spokesperson for Just Energy told CNN it sold all of Momentis\u2019 assets in March 2014 and has had no relationship with the company since then.   It\u2019s unclear what happened to M-Marketing Systems. By 2015, the website for M-Marketing was defunct, according to snapshots archived online.   34 Technologies also appears to have been short-lived. By 2014, two of 34 Technologies\u2019 executive officers were already working at a different multi-level marketing company partnered with Walker called Livio International that sold skincare products.   Walker\u2019s current business website, H-Walker Enterprises, has never listed the company as owned by Walker according to screenshots reviewed on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine that go back to 2018. The Facebook and Twitter accounts for 34 Technologies have not posted since 2013.   Former employees of both companies did not return CNN\u2019s request to speak to them.   Walker has not spoken about his tech company often but in one 2013 podcast he said the company had a first ever patented eCommerce video platform.   \u201cI have a tech company \u2013 where I\u2019m the first, we have the first ever patented video that you can do eCommerce off the video without leaving the video,\u201d Walker said on one 2013 podcast. \u201cAnd it will be out very soon.

CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed deleted tweets on Flores\u2019 campaign Twitter account, which previously had a different handle as her personal account before she ran for office.   Flores won the special election for Texas\u2019 34th Congressional District last week, giving Republicans an additional seat in the House of Representatives. She beat a field of four other candidates \u2013 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2013 in the race to succeed former Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela. Vela vacated his South Texas seat in March to join a law and lobbying firm in Washington. Flores will serve out the remainder of Vela\u2019s term and is running for a full term in November.   Before running for office, Flores was a local Republican activist who tweeted under the handle \u201cLaRepublicana86,\u201d where she spread false claims about election fraud and immediately began suggesting on January 6, 2021, that the Capitol riot was caused by Antifa and \u201cinfiltrators.\u201d   In one deleted tweet from January 7, 2021, Flores retweeted a claim that DC police had let crowds go to the Capitol and Antifa was among the crowd. \u201cDC police let them through the gates! This was a set up! Antifa is definitely among this crowd!!!,\u201d read the tweet from conservative activist David J. Harris that Flores shared.   In a tweet from January 6, Flores said the Capitol riot \u201csurely was caused by infiltrators.\u201d In another tweet that day, Flores posted images suggesting Capitol rioter Jacob Chansley \u2013 more commonly known as the QAnon Shaman \u2013 had also attended an Arizona Black Lives Matter rally. Following the Capitol riot, pro-Trump social media users attempted to falsely claim Chansley was a member of Blacks Live Matter and Antifa. The claim was repeatedly debunked.   In at least four other instances on Twitter, Flores shared a hashtag of the QAnon conspiracy theory in April and May 2020. Media Matters previously reported Flores had used several different QAnon slogans on Facebook and Instagram, including in at least one pro-Trump ad that ran on Facebook. Flores previously told the San Antonio Express-News that she did not believe in QAnon, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve always been against any of that. I\u2019ve never been supportive of it.\u201d   Flores did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.   Followers of the false QAnon conspiracy theory believe there is a \u201cdeep state\u201d within the US government that is controlled by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles. According to the theory, the cabal is largely run by Democratic politicians and liberal celebrities who work to traffic children, and Trump was trying to take them down with the help of QAnon \u201cpatriots.\u201d They believe their work will come to fruition on a day known as the \u201cStorm,\u201d when thousands of people will be arrested and face military tribunals and mass executions for their alleged crimes. The date has since passed and since Trump\u2019s defeat, the movement has responded to unfilled prophecies in different ways, with some followers adjusting their views and others becoming disillusioned.   Flores followed the false claims of election fraud closely, according to a review of her since-deleted tweets leading up to January 2021. She said that Trump attorney Sidney Powell \u2013 who provided no solid evidence for her claims of massive voter fraud in the 2020 election and currently is embroiled in lawsuits over past comments \u2013 was an \u201cAmerican hero.\u201d Flores wrote that \u201cthis election is not over\u201d in late November 2020 and claimed on December 1, 2020, that the \u201cliberal media\u201d wasn\u2019t covering voter fraud claims in Arizona.   Prior to the January 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally in Washington, DC, and subsequent riot at the Capitol, Flores urged Republican members of Congress to object to the election results.   \u201cCongressional Republicans MUST stand with @realDonaldTrump on Wednesday,\u201d she wrote in a tweet on January 4, 2021. On January 6, Flores shared a photo of the crowd at the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally, writing, \u201cIf we allow the Democrats to steal THIS election, they will steal EVERY election moving forward!\u201d On the 6th, Flores tweeted she was \u201cPraying for @Mike_Pence,\u201d prior to the riot.   Trump had urged then-Vice President Mike Pence to not accept election results from states that Trump falsely claimed had massive fraud.

In one speech uploaded to YouTube in 2015, Barnette forcefully argued it was OK to discriminate against Muslims and compared rejecting Islam to \u201c\u2026 rejecting Hitler\u2019s or Stalin\u2019s worldviews.\u201d In comments on her radio show, she said accepting homosexuality would lead to the accepting of incest and pedophilia. One post she wrote called a transgender person \u201cdeformed\u201d and \u201cdemonic.\u201d   Barnette surged in recent polls in the upcoming Pennsylvania Republican US Senate primary, putting her in a dead heat between Donald Trump-endorsed former TV star Mehmet Oz and former hedge fund manager David McCormick. The Pennsylvania Senate seat is one of the one of the best pickup opportunities for Democrats this November, and Barnette\u2019s sudden, rapid rise is causing worry among Trump allies.   Barnette has had a quick and unpredicted rise in the polls ahead of next Tuesday\u2019s primary. She is best known as an Army Reserves veteran and conservative political commentator who regularly appeared on Fox, and previously she was the host of a Christian radio show called \u201cTruth Exchange,\u201d which also had a website where she sometimes blogged. She previously ran for Congress in 2020 in Pennsylvania\u2019s 4th Congressional District but lost to Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean.   Barnette\u2019s campaign did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.   In posts, and comments on her radio show, Barnette frequently condemned being gay and transgender.   \u201cTwo men sleeping together, two men holding hands, two men caressing, that is not normal,\u201d she said on her radio show in July 2015, when a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for same-sex marriage.   On the same show, Barnette argued accepting same-sex marriage would lead to a \u201cslippery slope\u201d of accepting incest and pedophilia, in an episode that was deleted from her SoundCloud page after CNN\u2019s KFile reached out to the Barnette campaign for comment.   \u201cIf love is the litmus test, who are we to say, well, your love is legitimate love, same-sex couples, but your love, father and daughter, is not legitimate. Or your love, one man and three women, is not legitimate, or one older man and a 12-year-old child. If love is the litmus test, it becomes a very slippery slope. And that is where we, we find ourselves today.\u201d   In one 2015 post, Barnette attacked the transgender former reality star and Olympic champion Caitlyn Jenner as \u201cdeformed\u201d and \u201cdemonic,\u201d while attacking what she called a \u201cbarrage to normalize sexual perversion.\u201d In comments in the same post, Barnette warned of a \u201ctake-over\u201d occurring by the \u201cHomosexual agenda.\u201d   On another show from the same time, Barnette hosted \u201ctwo ex-gays\u201d to show \u201cthe real story behind all those happy \u2018gay\u2019 photos we see, & God\u2019s Redemptive story in both of their lives.\u201d One conversation featured the president of \u201cParents and Friends of Ex-Gays & Gays (PFOX).\u201d In one post from 2010, Barnette wrote the \u201chomosexual AGENDA\u201d seeks \u201cdomination.\u201d In a post in 2013, Barnette said America couldn\u2019t coexist with the \u201cHomosexual agenda.\u201d   \u201cThe aggressive homosexual agenda is coming soon to a kitchen table near you,\u201d she wrote.   In tweets and posts, Barnette frequently targeted Islam and Muslims. In one post, on her website, Barnette shared an obviously doctored image of a Muslim man holding up a sign in front of the rubble of the World Trade Center that said, \u201cVote Democrat! We need your help to kill you.\u201d   Speaking in December 2015, in a speech posted online, Barnette argued it was acceptable to discriminate against Muslims and Islam, comparing it to rejecting the worldviews of Stalin and Hitler, leaders who systematically discriminated against and ordered the killing of millions of people \u2013 including Jews, people with disabilities, Slavs and gay men.   \u201cYou are not a racist if you reject Islam, or if you reject Muslims, because they are not a race of people. They are a particular view. They are people that have a particular view of the world, and we have a right to discriminate against worldviews,\u201d she said. \u201cWe discriminated against Hitler\u2019s Nazi Germany view of the world, right? That was a worldview. That\u2019s how he saw the world around him. And we discriminated against it. We rejected it. We rejected Stalin\u2019s view \u2026 of the world, right?

Majewski, the Air Force veteran who won the GOP primary for Ohio\u2019s new 9th Congressional District, was a January 6 rally participant and has repeatedly shared pro-QAnon material \u2013 including a video showing him painting his lawn to say Trump 2020 with \u201cQ\u201d replacing the zeros.   Majewski emerged victorious in Tuesday\u2019s crowded Republican primary and will face off against long-serving Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur in the newly drawn district this November.   Before running for Congress, Majewski was best known as the Trump supporter who painted his front lawn into a 19,000-square-foot Trump 2020 sign. He later appeared in the MAGA rapper Forgiato Blow\u2019s song \u201cLet\u2019s Go Brandon Save America,\u201d by rapping one verse decrying \u201cwoke\u201d politics after he launched his campaign.   Majewski was deployed in the Middle East in the early 2000s during Operation Enduring Freedom, according to his campaign website. He currently works in the nuclear energy industry.   CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed since-deleted and public tweets that show Majewski with a group of people who attended the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally throughout the day in various places outside the Capitol \u2013 including a video in which a member of the group leads them in repeating the slogan of QAnon. The camera moves past Majewski in the crowd just before the slogan is repeated, so he is not visible as other members in the group are seen saying the slogan. Majewski has denied being a QAnon follower.   Majewski and the man who initally shouted the slogan appear to have briefly hosted a YouTube show together called \u201cEarCandy.\u201d It appeared on Majewski\u2019s YouTube channel before being removed. The same channel now appears to represent his campaign.   \u201cWhere we go one, we go all,\u201d the group said, repeating the catchphrase in QAnon mythology.   Followers of the tentpole QAnon conspiracy theory believe there is a \u201cdeep state\u201d within the US government that is controlled by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles. According to the theory, the cabal is largely run by Democratic politicians and liberal celebrities who work to traffic children \u2013 and former President Donald Trump is trying to take them down with the help of QAnon \u201cpatriots.\u201d Their work will come to fruition on a day known as the \u201cStorm,\u201d when thousands of people will be arrested and face military tribunals and mass executions for their alleged crimes.

In April 2021, Majewski denied supporting QAnon in an interview with the Toledo Blade, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never read any QAnon drop \u2014 what they call the \u2018Q-Drop.\u201d A \u201cQ-drop\u201d refers to messages posted by the anonymous \u201cQ\u201d who originally fed the conspiracy theory.   But a CNN KFile review of Majewski\u2019s tweets shows that despite claiming not to follow Q\u2019s updates, Majewski engaged with QAnon hashtags, memes and rhetoric frequently online prior to this interview. Between July 2020 and January 2021 on his now-deleted personal Twitter account, Majewski tweeted the QAnon hashtag #WWG1WGA \u2013 which stands for \u201cWhere we go one, we go all\u201d \u2013 more than 50 times.   He also shared other overt QAnon hashtags such as #QArmy, #PatriotsAwakened, #DemoPedo and #WakeUpAmerica and QAnon-themed memes, including an image of a \u201cQ\u201d colored in with an American flag and the \u201cWhere We Go One We Go All\u201d QAnon catchphrase in July 2020. On several occasions, he substituted the letter \u201cQ\u201d in pro-Trump phrases, such as the \u201cSilent MajQrity\u201d and \u201cTrump 2Q2Q.\u201d He also tweeted at a QAnon fan account called Qanon76.   After Majewski gained national attention for his Trump lawn, he appeared in news coverage wearing a white T-shirt with a large \u201cQ\u201d embellished with an American flag. He later replied to a tweet confirming that it was a \u201cQ,\u201d and noted that he also wore a Trump 2020 badge the campaign had asked him to wear. A day later, he tweeted, \u201cHere come the helicopters flying over better get my Qutfit on and hit the front yard Gotta do the #GoodGuyStuff #PatriotsAwakened #WWG1WGA.\u201d   Majewski later altered his infamous Trump lawn sign to read \u201cTrump 2Q2Q,\u201d according to a since-deleted post on the social media website Parler.   Majewski also tweeted more insular references to QAnon, suggesting a greater familiarity with the conspiracy theory beyond hashtags. In August 2020, he noted on Twitter that Trump had answered 17 questions at a news conference, a significant number in QAnon lore as \u201cQ\u201d is the 17th letter in the alphabet.   In another tweet, Majewski defended QAnon followers for their \u201cnever ending\u201d and \u201cunwavering\u201d support of Trump.   \u201cEveryone has a part to play. Regardless of what you perceive to be of #Qanon [sic] Their support for @potus is never ending and unwavering. That in itself gives credence and it is what has gained them accolades. I am hopeful that you would redact this and take a different perspective,\u201d wrote Majewski in November 2020, two days after the election.   In one tweet, he speculated that \u201ceverything was real\u201d from the anonymous Q poster but that its followers have become the real Q.

Jackson\u2019s popularity should only help her in the confirmation process.   A few years ago, I built a statistical model to help understand why senators vote the way they do on Supreme Court nominees. The model took into account variables such as a nominee\u2019s qualifications, the ideology of the nominee and the senator, etc.   One of the factors I included was public sentiment about a nominee. Holding everything else equal, nominees got more votes when they were more popular with the public. Clarence Thomas, for example, was generally viewed in 1991 as very conservative and not as well qualified as many earlier nominees. Yet, Thomas was confirmed by a Democratic-controlled Senate.   A lot of that may have had to do with the fact that he was popular. Thomas had a +33-point net popularity rating among Americans, according to an average of polling taken before he was confirmed.   Jackson could join Roberts as the only Supreme Court nominees this century to achieve a popularity level anywhere near where Thomas was some 30 years ago.   Indeed, one of the big stories of Supreme Court nominations this century is how divisive they\u2019ve generally been with the American public. Since 2005, nominees who either got a Senate vote or withdrew their nominations averaged only a +10-point net popularity rating in their final polls.   Compare that with nominees from 1986 to 1994, who averaged a +26-point net popularity rating in their final polls before their Senate vote or withdrawal of their nomination.   This strong popularity for earlier nominees helps, at least in small part, to explain why most of them flew through their confirmation hearings and why many this century have generally had a harder time.   Of course, we probably shouldn\u2019t expect Jackson to get anywhere near the number of votes Roberts got from senators (78). The Senate has grown more polarized in general, with senators less likely to cross the aisle over the last 30 years \u2013 more so over the last 15 to 20 years. That\u2019s another big reason why even confirmed Supreme Court nominees are getting fewer \u201cyes\u201d votes than they used to.   Still, it would be surprising if Jackson didn\u2019t get at least a few Republican votes. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio seem the most likely given how often they\u2019ve voted with Biden this Congress.   The good news for Democrats is that even if Jackson doesn\u2019t get any Republican votes, the polarization would still help her. It is unlikely that any Democrat will vote against her. With the Senate Democratic Caucus controlling 50 seats and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking any tie votes, all Jackson needs for confirmation is Democratic support.   The Jackson confirmation hearings and the Russian invasion of the Ukraine are basically all you see on cable tv right now. From Monday through Wednesday this week, there were over 4,300 mentions of \u201cUkraine\u201d and over 1,400 mentions of \u201cSupreme Court\u201d across CNN, Fox News and MSNBC, per the Internet Archive\u2019s Television News Archive.   There were just 220 mentions of inflation by comparison.   Yet, that\u2019s what voters care the most about. In a CBS News/YouGov poll from earlier this month, 46% said the \u201ceconomy and jobs\u201d or \u201cinflation\u201d were the most important issues facing the country. No other issue came close.   This could explain why there\u2019s been a minimal \u201crally around the flag\u201d effect for Biden following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While the President\u2019s approval rating seemed to rise by a point or two initially, any rise has since flattened out. Biden\u2019s average approval rating stands in the low 40s with a disapproval rating in the mid 50s.   Notably, Biden\u2019s approval rating on the economy has been stuck in the high 30s with little sign of movement over the past month. In contrast, his approval rating on the Russia-Ukraine situation has risen over the past month. This rise has had little impact on his overall approval rating.   The importance of the economy to voters has been clear throughout Biden\u2019s term so far. His overall approval ratings have tracked closely with his ratings on the economy, which have ranged from the high 50s to the upper 30s.   The fact that the economy has remained important to determining the temperature of the electorate shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Even with a global pandemic, the 2020 election result tracked well with what would have been expected with a lackluster, though not awful, economy.   It\u2019s a reminder that what dominates the airwaves doesn\u2019t necessarily dominate the minds on Main Street.   I asked two friends whether they would be watching the Oscars this weekend. Neither knew it was actually on. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m shocked. While more than 40 million people watched the Academy Awards in 2014, viewership has been on decline in recent years. About 10 million people watched last year.   I covered this and other statistics about the Oscars (including who is favored to win) in a recent article. Check it out if you, like my friends, aren\u2019t up to snuff on what was once a cultural touchstone.   Last week\u2019s results: I asked you all what you were more looking forward to watching \u2013 the NCAA basketball tournament or the start of the Major League Baseball season?   A plurality of respondents were more into the NCAA tourney. \u2013 though the comments in support didn\u2019t exactly represent a ringing endorsement for the most part. \u201cI really don\u2019t care much about college ball, but as a reds fan, I care about baseball that much less,\u201d @its_kduff said.   There were some baseball backers as well. Here\u2019s what @DillonRae96 had to say: \u201cPersonally MLB season, grew up in Tucson so the college basketball culture was absolutely shoved in your face at every turn.\u201d   Of course, a few of you fell into neither camp. Like soccer fan @srneal3, who noted, \u201cThe MLS and NWSL seasons just started.\u201d   In-person worship services: A new poll from the Pew Research Center showed that 43% of those who attend religious services once a month said the house of worship they attend most often is open the same way it was before the coronavirus pandemic. In March 2021, it was just 12%.   Early midterm poll accuracy: A review of gubernatorial and Senate polls since 1998 by FiveThirtyEight has a mixed bag of news of those hoping to forecast the future. While either side has about an equal chance of winning races that are polling within 5 points at this stage of the cycle, the side that is ahead wins about 75% of races when they are up 5 to 10 points and about 90% of races when they have a lead of 10 points or more.   Helping others: A Gallup study found strong growth across the world in people helping strangers, volunteering time to organizations and donating money to charities over the course of the pandemic, with participation in such activities increasing by nearly 25%.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN Sans \u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network.", "Ron DeSantis follows the Trump playbook ahead of 2024 | CNN Politics": " The Russian invasion of Ukraine, not surprisingly, remains the top news story this week. That will likely be the case as long as the war and the devastation continue.   Still, there are stories on the domestic front that have also been making waves, both from a statistical angle and for their political implications.   If we\u2019ve learned anything from the last two presidential cycles, it\u2019s that free media is worth a lot in presidential primaries. Trump got a historic amount of free media attention in 2016, and now-President Joe Biden led the pack for free media on the Democratic side during the 2020 primary season.   DeSantis seems like he\u2019s the next major \u201cfree media\u201d beneficiary. One of the few non-Ukraine news stories to break through in the last few weeks was the outcry over the new Florida legislation that critics have dubbed \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay.\u201d (My colleague Zach Wolf has a strong article on what is actually in the bill and what it means.)   Indeed, DeSantis is continuing to lap other potential non-Trump 2024 candidates in Fox cable mentions. In about the last six months, \u201cDeSantis\u201d has been mentioned 920 to 950 times (depending on the day you start counting from), per the Internet Archive\u2019s Television News Archive. \u201c[Mike] Pence\u201d and \u201c[Ted] Cruz\u201d have been mentioned about 900 times \u2013 combined.   The same was true nearly a year ago when I wrote \u201cHow the numbers show Ron DeSantis\u2019 stock is rising.\u201d It doesn\u2019t hurt DeSantis that the bill that recently passed in Florida is popular among Republicans, both in-state and nationally, and that he is a strong favorite for reelection as governor this year.   The idea behind my piece in 2021 was that DeSantis should be considered a Republican front-runner for 2024, if Trump decided not to run.   At this point, I think we can replace \u201ca\u201d with \u201cthe\u201d in that last sentence. To be sure, Trump is the favorite for the GOP nomination in 2024 if he runs, but DeSantis is clearly the next most likely nominee.   The Florida governor is second in pretty much every national 2024 GOP primary poll that includes Trump as an option. He\u2019s also the only other Republican to almost always crack double digits in these polls.   When Trump is not included, DeSantis has the advantage in nearly every survey, usually polling in the mid-20s. That\u2019s quite similar to where Biden was in early 2020 Democratic primary polls. It\u2019s an enviable, though not infallible, position.   DeSantis is polling this well despite not being as well known to voters as Trump and Biden. Nearly 40% of Republicans had no opinion of DeSantis, a January Marquette University Law School poll found.   But while Trump had a higher favorability rating among Republicans than DeSantis (74% versus 52%), DeSantis\u2019 favorability rating among Republicans who were knowledgeable enough to have an opinion was higher than Trump\u2019s (about 83% to about 75%).   Indeed, the governor is in a much stronger position in the one place where voters know both DeSantis and Trump well \u2013 Florida. DeSantis and Trump are within single digits of each other in an average of polls for a hypothetical 2024 primary in the Sunshine State. Trump calls Florida home now, and he easily won the 2016 Republican primary there over home-state Sen. Marco Rubio.   We\u2019ll have to see what happens once Republicans nationwide know DeSantis as well as Republicans in Florida do.   Another story that garnered major headlines this week was about a man who senselessly shot homeless people in New York and Washington, DC. While a suspect is under arrest, the fact is that crime continues to be an issue in American cities.   Violent crime rose during the coronavirus pandemic in many American cities. Although we don\u2019t know exactly why, it\u2019s notable that this increase happened just when daily life was interrupted.   This year, the pandemic has been less of an issue, but rates of violent crime still seem to be rising in the biggest American cities.   In New York, the number of complaints for violent crime is up 27% from this point last year.   In Los Angeles, it\u2019s up 5% from this time last year.   And in Chicago, complaints of violent crime are up 9% from last year.   All three cities have seen similar (in the case of Los Angeles) or larger (45% in New York and 34% in Chicago) increases in their overall crime rates within the past year.   The good news from the stats is that the murder (or homicide) rate does seem to be down in all three cities. Unfortunately, the murder rate tells only part of the story.   The higher crime rate in these cities is getting people\u2019s attention. A record percentage of New York City voters (74%) said crime was a very serious problem, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. It ranked as the top issue facing the city, the poll found.   In Washington, (where violent crime is up 20% and overall crime is up 9% from this point last year), 36% of residents said the No. 1 problem facing the city that they wanted the mayor to solve was crime, violence or guns, per a recent Washington Post poll. No other issue mentioned by DC residents as the biggest problem got more than 14% in the survey.   We\u2019ll see if this eventually translates into crime becoming a bigger national story. As I pointed out in January, it hasn\u2019t yet.   On the lighter side of the news, you may be watching or about to watch an NCAA basketball tournament game. If you have any interest in the topic, I\u2019d suggest you check out my piece on the tournament, how much work productivity is lost during March Madness and the chances of Duke losing.   One thing I will point out is that only about 15% of Americans even fill out college basketball brackets every year. Given that low percentage, I can assure you that no one really wants to hear how good or bad you\u2019re doing at predicting results.   Question of the week: Are you more excited for the NCAA tournament or for the start of Major League Baseball in April? Tell us about it here, and we\u2019ll report the results next week.   Last week\u2019s results: I asked you all last week to give us your thoughts on changing the clocks for daylight saving time.   Most of you were in favor of making daylight saving time permanent. For instance, Chris Peterson tweeted, \u201cDaylight Saving time all year, but time zones should shift east by several hundred miles to ensure sunrise times in winter are within a reasonable window.\u201d   A vocal minority were in favor of keeping standard time all year round. \u201cIt\u2019s the natural time, defined by the sun and longitude. Why fight nature instead of working with it?\u201d tweeted Kristen Tullo.   And Mark Pritchard came in with this novel idea: \u201cWhat we need is Weekend Savings Time. Clocks move forward one hour every Friday at 4 pm: suddenly it\u2019s 5 pm and the weekend! Clocks move back every Sunday night: now you have an extra hour of sleep before Monday.\u201d   Little did I know then that the US Senate would hear your calls and vote by unanimous consent to make daylight saving time a year-round affair. We\u2019ll see what the House and Biden do about it.   Sleep problems: Having trouble sleeping? If so, you\u2019re not alone. A mere 32% of American adults said they had slept excellent or very good the previous night, according to a new Gallup poll. That compares with 33% who reported \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d sleep. (The rest said \u201cgood.\u201d) More Americans under age 50 (38%) said they had slept fairly or poorly than those 65 and older (24%).   Masks at work: Just 39% of American workers said their workplaces had mask mandates last week, per an Axios/Ipsos poll. At no other time since the question was first asked in August 2021 had that percentage fallen below a majority. This comes as Covid-19 rates are rising in Europe and signs emerge of the potential for similar spikes in parts of the US.   French presidential election: Last week, I noted that Biden seemed to be benefiting from a bit of a \u201crally around the flag\u201d effect following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. One politician who is definitely receiving a bounce in his ratings is French President Emmanuel Macron. He faces reelection in about three weeks, and polls now show him over 30% in the first round, well ahead of the competition. As long as he finishes in the top two ahead of a likely runoff, Macron will be a heavy favorite for a second term.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Paul Gosar\u2019s lengthy ties to White nationalists, pro-Nazi blogger and far-right fringe received little pushback for years | CNN Politics": " Last spring, Republican Rep. Paul Gosar and a small group of volunteers traveled to the southern border city of San Luis, Arizona, to clean up the city\u2019s trash.   The small group included a blogger who has praised Nazi Germany; a Gosar-endorsed congressional candidate who would be removed from Twitter for calling for executing election officials; and a speaker removed from the 2020 Republican National Convention for sharing an antisemitic conspiracy theory describing an elaborate Jewish plan for global domination.   Since 2018, when Gosar dined with a European extremist who called for banning Islam from Europe, the far-right Arizona lawmaker has boosted the profiles of local antisemites, attended a conference organized by a prominent White nationalist, and repeatedly shared content from a Holocaust denial website.   Gosar is now facing scrutiny over his ties to extremists after speaking via video at a conference organized by White nationalist Nick Fuentes. Gosar spoke in person at the event last year. And both Gosar, and his colleague Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who spoke in person at the conference this year, have been condemned by Republican leaders over their appearances.   Gosar has also shared animated images of political violence against his colleagues. In November, Gosar shared a photoshopped anime video on social media showing him appearing to kill New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden. He was then censured by the House and stripped of his committee assignments, but only two Republicans \u2013 Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney \u2013 voted to censure Gosar for promoting violence.   Republican leadership has yet to discipline Gosar, or Greene for that matter, for their ties to White nationalists beyond harsh words, even though, three years ago, they stripped another congressman from House committees \u200bfor lamenting that the terms White nationalist and White supremacist were considered \u201coffensive.\u201d   Gosar\u2019s ties to extremists go back further than the violent social media posts he was censured for. He has long associations with White nationalists, a pro-Nazi blogger and far-right fringe players that have received little examination compared to his colleagues, according to an extensive CNN KFile review of Gosar\u2019s events and social media posts over the years.   His endorsement, along with Greene\u2019s, has become highly sought after in local and national political primaries by like-minded candidates.   A spokesperson for Gosar declined to comment on specific questions about the congressman\u2019s associates and instead offered a statement disparaging CNN\u2019s reporting.   In his home state, Gosar engaged with local far-right Arizona figures, including sharing a post from Kyle Clifton, who has shared antisemitic images, and appeared in photos with Greyson Arnold, who has expressed admiration for Nazi Germany.   The April 2021 trip Gosar took to the border included Arnold, a far-right blogger who has shared a post saying \u201cJewish led colored hordes\u201d are fighting the \u201cWhite Christian West.\u201d Arnold has repeatedly shared content saying the US fought on the wrong side in World War II, spread antisemitic conspiracy theories and falsely claimed there were \u201cJewish plans to genocide the German people.\u201d He recently shared posts questioning teaching of the Holocaust, calling it the original \u201ccritical race theory.\u201d   Arnold regularly posts on the social media site Telegram under the moniker \u201cPure Politics.\u201d He wrote on Telegram he was invited by Gosar to the trip, and can be seen in various photos from attendees documenting the visit, which Gosar said was to pick up trash he claimed was left by \u201cillegal aliens pouring over our border.\u201d   The trip also included right-wing activist Mary Ann Mendoza, who was abruptly pulled from speaking at the Republican National Convention in 2020 after she spread an antisemitic conspiracy theory describing an elaborate Jewish plan for global domination. She later deleted the tweet and claimed that she hadn\u2019t read \u201cevery post within the thread.\u201d \u201cMy apologies for not paying attention to the intent of the whole message,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cThat does not reflect my feelings or personal thoughts whatsoever.\u201d   Another attendee, congressional candidate Jarome Bell, would later be banned from Twitter for calling for executing election officials. He had previously posted in 2020 his partial support of instituting martial law and arresting people for \u201ctreason and sedition\u201d after the 2020 election.   In October 2020, Gosar was interviewed by Arnold during an event in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, where he told Arnold, \u201cWe really are in a civil war. It\u2019s just that the gunfire hasn\u2019t started.\u201d And this past January, Gosar shared on his Instagram page a photo posted from Arnold at an event with Gosar this year.   Jared Holt, a fellow at the Atlantic Council and an expert on domestic extremism, told CNN that politicians like Gosar and Greene speaking and associating with these figures and groups gives those ideas new credibility and legitimacy.   On social media, Gosar regularly engages with far-right personalities and memes. Gosar has repeatedly promoted the work of and tagged Vincent James Foxx, who was recently banned from Twitter and has a history of deeply antisemitic statements. The Anti-Defamation League has labeled Foxx as a White supremacist.   Gosar shared on Instagram a screenshot of himself with Ethan Schmidt-Crockett, who harassed a store specializing in wigs for cancer patients last summer because it required customers to wear masks and is the founder of the AntiMaskersClub. Schmidt-Crockett was recently banned from the Arizona House after harassing a Democratic lawmaker by using a racial slur. In a video of Gosar and Schmidt-Crockett posted in December 2021, Gosar encourages the \u201cAnti Vaxxers Club\u201d to stay the course.   In November 2020, Gosar credited Mike Cernovich with a Phoenix \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally after the 2020 election, comparing Cernovich to civil rights icon Rosa Parks.   Cernovich, a far-right commentator, is best known for his role peddling far-right conspiracy theories, including \u201cPizzagate,\u201d which bizarrely and falsely claimed Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman John Podesta were connected to a pedophilia ring run in a Washington, DC, pizza restaurant. The incident came to a head in December 2016 when a man fired an AR-15 inside the restaurant, saying he was attempting to find and rescue child sex slaves he believed were being held there. No one was injured.   Gosar has also shared a column on Twitter from the UNZ Review, a website that has published Holocaust denialism and columns in support of White nationalism.   He has shared a political consultant, Noel Fritsch, on his political campaigns with Paul Nehlen, the racist and antisemitic candidate who attempted to primary then-House Speaker Paul Ryan. The same consultant advised Bell, and Lauren Witzke, a 2020 congressional candidate who embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory.   Gosar has also regularly appeared on fringe media, like the radio show of Dr. Bill Deagle, a conspiracy theorist who says the government created AIDS \u2013 and said such in his interview with Gosar to no pushback. He has also appeared multiple times on and shared content from the show of Stew Peters, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who has on multiple occasions called for hanging Dr. Anthony Fauci.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

A CNN KFile review of Finchem\u2019s social media postings on platforms popular with the extreme right wing found that he repeatedly promoted anti-vaccine rhetoric and other false claims about possible Covid-19 treatments, the efficacy of mask-wearing and the severity of the virus.   In August 2021, Finchem shared a story riddled with misinformation on the coronavirus and vaccine on the platform Gab \u2013 a social media network popular with conservatives, the alt-right and some extremists \u2013 writing, \u201cIt ain\u2019t a vaccine!!! Call it what it is, a crime against humanity.\u201d   Finchem also shared an image last August falsely claiming that a province in Canada had lifted its Covid protocols because \u201cthey can\u2019t produce an isolated sample of SARS-CoV-2 to prove covid exists to back their mandates.\u201d   \u201cNow that\u2019s a problem,\u201d he wrote on Gab.   In July 2021, Finchem shared an article from a conspiracy website frequented by the far right that falsely says \u201cthe life expectancy of all who have taken the [vaccine] is only 2 years,\u201d because it alters human blood cells, claims that have been thoroughly debunked.   \u201cMuch more work needs to be don [sic] on the \u2018vaccine\u2019 than has been done. If this is true, and I am not saying it is or is not, then we need to brace ourselves for a new order of diseases that we have never seen before,\u201d wrote Finchem on Telegram, a messaging app popular with the far right.   Later in July 2021, he wrote in a post on Gab that he refuses to take the vaccine because he falsely believes it is a \u201cpotentially deadly gene therapy.\u201d   In other posts on Gab, Finchem downplayed the severity of the coronavirus pandemic by comparing the virus to other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, which the World Health Organization recognizes as \u201ctreatable and curable,\u201d in one June 2021 shared post.   \u201c10 million people contracted Tuberculosis in 2019. 1.5 million died from this airborne infectious disease. Did you even know? Were you scared for your life? Did we wear masks, close schools, and ruin small businesses? No. Why? Because the media didn\u2019t tell you to be scared,\u201d read the post Finchem shared in June 2021.   CNN reached out multiple times to Finchem for comment but did not receive a response.   More than 27,000 Arizonans have died of Covid-19 since March 2020, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services. The state has the second most deaths per 100,000 people, with 373. Covid-19 has killed more than 900,000 people in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, officially making the disease the most deadly outbreak in recent American history.   While Finchem peddled anti-vaccine conspiracies, he also wrote and shared multiple posts on Gab and Telegram in 2021 supporting the use of hydroxychloroquine, a drug once touted by Trump, to treat Covid as a \u201cbeneficial medication.\u201d   The National Institutes of Health determined in November 2020 that use of the drug does not benefit adults hospitalized with the virus.   Finchem also criticized scientifically proven Covid-19 mitigation measures, calling mask-wearing \u201ccrap psudeosciene\u201d (sic) and isolating a \u201cdisaster.\u201d He questioned the efficacy of social distancing by sharing a May 2021 post on Gab from an account that said they \u201cdon\u2019t social distance\u201d but are still alive.   If elected, Finchem would be first in the line of succession for the governorship because Arizona does not have a lieutenant governor. In the most recently filed fundraising reports in Arizona, Finchem had the second-largest haul among all candidates, with nearly $663,000 last year, trailing advertising executive Edward \u201cBeau\u201d Lane, one of three other candidates seeking the GOP nomination, who had total receipts of more than $716,000.   Before serving as an Arizona state representative starting in 2015, Finchem worked as a real estate agent, a firefighter and a law enforcement officer. He currently works as an energy policy analyst, according to his LinkedIn and financial disclosure form.   As his profile grew from state lawmaker to statewide candidate, Finchem perhaps became best known for peddling lies about the 2020 election.   He has become one of the most outspoken supporters of the lie that Trump won the election, earning him the former President\u2019s endorsement last fall.   The endorsement of Finchem came nearly a year after he had  worked closely with Trump acolytes to sow doubt about the 2020 election. In a March 2021 podcast, Finchem said he had received a call from the Rudy Giuliani team, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, about organizing a meeting on election fraud in Arizona shortly after the 2020 election.   Months later, Finchem attended the January 6 rally that preceded the attack on the US Capitol but has said he never came within 500 yards of the Capitol that day and has repeatedly denied participating in the riot. The Arizona Mirror later reported that Finchem was seen approximately 100 yards from the steps of the Capitol; Finchem did not respond to the publication\u2019s comment request.   Finchem has also peddled the QAnon conspiracy theory, writing in one deleted 2019 tweet that Congress was implicated in child abuse, and was a member of the Oath Keepers back in 2014, though it\u2019s unclear if he still affiliated with the group.   In one interview from January 2021, one of the hosts of the \u201cThrive Time Show\u201d podcast falsely asserted that votes had been sent to Amazon servers in Frankfurt, Germany, to switch the votes using election software. Finchem responded, \u201cYou\u2019re not making that up.\u201d   Finchem also promoted debunked Dominion Voting Systems conspiracy theories around the 2020 election, appearing on a QAnon talk show in May 2021 to say the company had \u201cintent to throw the election.\u201d   He has similarly endorsed numerous other conspiracy theories surrounding the aftermath of the 2020 election.

In previously unreported videos from the social media platform Periscope reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile, Ali Alexander, a leader of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally and a central figure in the House select committee\u2019s investigation of January 6, said he would reach out to the right-wing Proud Boys and Oath Keepers on providing security for the event. Both groups later had members charged in the attack on the Capitol, including conspiracy. Last week, the Justice Department charged the Oath Keepers leader and 10 others with seditious conspiracy related to the attack.   Alexander has not been charged or implicated in any unlawful act. He has denied working with anyone, including lawmakers or extremist groups, to attack the Capitol.   In other videos removed from Periscope \u2013 it\u2019s unknown who removed the videos, when and why \u2013 Alexander claimed to describe further details of his communications and coordination with several Congressional Republicans pushing to overturn the election result. The lawmakers have denied planning rallies or coordinating with Alexander in any way.   An attorney for Alexander denied that his client worked with the Proud Boys but acknowledged that Alexander did try to help them with housing; the attorney also said the Oath Keepers did provide security for several events.   While some of Alexander\u2019s Periscope videos have been previously reported by CNN, these additional videos provide new details of his claims about his contacts with extremist groups and lawmakers in the lead-up to the rally. They also show the heated rhetoric used by Alexander to describe his efforts, including speculating that a civil war could occur if the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement\u2019s efforts were successful and that he\u2019d rather see the White House be struck by lightning and \u201cburn down\u201d than have then President-elect Joe Biden enter it.   In one livestream video on December 23, 2020, entitled \u201cJAN6,\u201d Alexander said to his followers that he planned to reach out to the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers about providing security for the January 6 rally.   \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m gonna make sure so many people are so safe. It\u2019s gonna make your head spin. I\u2019m gonna try to make sure that every 15 minutes \u2013 so that you just know in your head, you don\u2019t have to know in a map \u2013 that Metro stops are being patrolled,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna try to go that deep into it. I\u2019m gonna talk to the Proud Boys. I\u2019m gonna talk to the Oath Keepers and I\u2019m gonna try to get patrols going, okay, of men that go for hours.\u201d   In another video from December 29, 2020, Alexander said he spoke to the Proud Boys to make sure they had lodging covered for the event after a hotel frequented by the group said it would close in early January temporarily.   \u201cI\u2019ll find you a room,\u201d Alexander said in a livestream addressing the camera. \u201cMy team will find you a room. I talked tonight to the Proud Boys to make sure that they were all covered.\u201d   Dozens of members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers have been charged in the attack on the US Capitol. Prosecutors have said members of both groups conspired ahead of time to disrupt the Electoral College proceeding. Both groups have been the subject of subpoenas by the January 6 committee.   Baron Coleman, Alexander\u2019s attorney, told CNN his client \u201cdid not work with the Proud Boys,\u201d saying his \u201ccolorful remarks or exaggerations during playful livestreams contextualize his intentions.\u201d But he said his client did offer to help them find new housing and the Oath Keepers did provide security for several events.   Alexander has not been charged or implicated in any unlawful act and he has denied working with anyone, including lawmakers, to attack the Capitol. In his December testimony, he claimed that the evidence he handed over to the committee exonerated himself and members of Congress.   \u201cAnyone who suggests I had anything to do with the unlawful activities on January 6 is wrong. They\u2019re either mistaken or lying,\u201d Alexander said in his opening statement to the committee on December 9.   Coleman, Alexander\u2019s attorney, also argued to CNN in an email that the clips provided seemed out of context, arguing Alexander was joking or exaggerating in clips. He said all of Alexander\u2019s rallies were peaceful.   \u201cUsing tiny clips from the thousands of hours of extemporaneous speaking that Ali produced during the 2020 election cycle seems out of context and without regard to the truth,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAll of Ali\u2019s rallies, to this date, remain peaceful and without incident. All of the dozens of rallies he did, all peaceful, without incident. The other ones under his care post-Election Day; all peaceful and without incident.\u201d   After at least two rallies in Washington, DC, however, clashes between protesters and counterprotesters turned violent. At a November 14 rally, violence erupted between the groups after dark and at least 20 people were arrested. And after the December 12 rally, at least four people were stabbed after an evening of faceoffs with counterprotesters; at least 33 people were arrested, including six people for assaulting police officers.   Alexander previously worked as a Republican political operative under the name of Ali Akbar on John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign and a handful of political action committees before rebranding himself as an outspoken supporter of Trump. Alexander gained notoriety after he began posting videos of himself espousing pro-Trump and far-right views in 2019 on social media and for his work with MAGA conspiracy theorists Jacob Wohl and Laura Loomer.   The extent of Alexander\u2019s work with members of Congress, the Trump campaign and the Trump White House has been a subject of interest for the House committee investigating January 6. Alexander sat in early December for a deposition and claimed in a court filing he told lawmakers of his interactions with Republican representatives.   He has also handed over thousands of text messages and communication records that include his interactions with members of Congress and former President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle leading up to the riot at the Capitol.   The purpose of the Stop the Steal movement\u2019s work, Alexander said in a previously reported video first highlighted by the nonpartisan watchdog organization Project On Government Oversight in January 2021, was to build public pressure to intimidate members of Congress.   \u201cI\u2019m the guy who came up with the idea of January 6th when I was talking with Congressman [Paul] Gosar, Congressman Andy Biggs, and Congressman Mo Brooks,\u201d he said on December 28, 2020. \u201cSo, we\u2019re the four guys who came up with a January 6th event, hashtag \u2018do not certify.\u2019 And it was to build momentum and pressure, and then on the day change hearts and minds of Congresspeoples [sic] who weren\u2019t yet decided or saw everyone outside and said, \u2018I can\u2019t be on the other side of that mob.\u2019\u201d   New videos unearthed by CNN\u2019s KFile offer new details of these communications.   In one Periscope video from January 2, 2021 \u2013 four days before the session to certify the Electoral College results \u2013 Alexander claimed Arizona\u2019s Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona worked with him to pressure senators to object to certifying the results of the 2020 election. In the same recording, Alexander, speaking straight to the camera, said he worked with Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks and Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar to gather Republican votes protesting the election results.   \u201cWho worked with Congressman Mo Brooks to whip up votes in the House,\u201d Alexander said in the livestream. \u201c[Who worked with] Congressman Paul Gosar to whip up votes in the House, Congressman Andy Biggs, to not only whip up votes in the House, but also let me know who the soft senators were because he briefed them in the Steering committee? Boom, we\u2019ve been doing the work.\u201d   Alexander had also mentioned speaking with Brooks in an earlier video from December 17, 2020.   \u201cI will tell you, I have talked with Mo Brooks,\u201d Alexander said of the lawmaker. \u201cWe are talking personally. I\u2019ve talked with the staff and I\u2019ve talked with him.\u201d   None of the lawmakers contacted by CNN returned repeated requests for comment. Spokespeople for Biggs and Brooks have previously denied planning rallies or coordinating with Alexander in any way.   After the attack on the Capitol last January, Biggs\u2019 spokesperson told CNN, \u201cCongressman Biggs is not aware of hearing of or meeting Mr. Alexander at any point \u2013 let alone working with him to organize some part of a planned protest.\u201d   The spokesperson added that Biggs \u201cdid not have any contact with protestors or rioters, nor did he ever encourage or foster the rally or protests. He was focused on his research and arguments to work within the confines of the law and established precedent to restore integrity to our elections, and to ensure that all Americans \u2013 regardless of party affiliation \u2013 can again have complete trust in our elections systems.\u201d   A spokesperson for Brooks last month denied that the congressman was in contact with Alexander beyond one \u201cbenign\u201d text message sent in mid-December 2020 from Alexander, in which Alexander identified himself as the founder of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement and claimed the two met in 2010. The spokesperson said Brooks did not recognize the number and had \u201cno personal knowledge\u201d about who the sender was.   Also in that December 17 video, Alexander called Marjorie Taylor Greene, who at that point had been elected but not sworn in as a Georgia representative, \u201ca friend of mine\u201d who would help their efforts to object to the election results.   A spokesperson for Greene\u2019s office previously told Rolling Stone that she and her office \u201chad nothing to do with planning of any protest.\u201d   In another previously unreported video, Alexander claimed that Gosar came up with the idea for a march in Washington, DC on to protest the results of the election, though he did not specify which march. Alexander\u2019s attorney told CNN that his client was referring to the first rally in Washington DC in November.   \u201cI got a call from Congressman Gosar,\u201d Alexander said in a speech at a rally on December 3, 2020. \u201cHe\u2019s the spirit animal of Stop the Steal. He\u2019s actually the originator of the DC march. He called me and said, \u2018Y\u2019all need to march on DC.\u2019 I said, \u2018We\u2019ll see what we can do.\u2019\u201d   In one video from December 21, 2020, Alexander said he shared a dinner with Gosar a day earlier.   Gosar\u2019s chief of staff previously told the New York Times that Alexander was \u201ca solid organizer,\u201d but that Gosar\u2019s office, while it promoted the events, was not involved in planning them.   The videos unearthed by CNN\u2019s KFile also show the heated rhetoric that Alexander used leading up to the January 6, 2021, rally.   In one video from early January 2021, Alexander speculated that being successful on January 6 might lead to a civil war. In the same video, he said he\u2019d rather see the White House \u201cburn down,\u201d than have Biden enter it.   Alexander\u2019s attorney said his comments about the White House were \u201cin jest.\u201d   \u201cThere\u2019s no circumstance that I think is legitimate that Joe Biden should enter the White House,\u201d he said on January 1, 2021. \u201cI think the White House should burn down and I\u2019m not saying that \u2013 I\u2019m not telling anyone to, but I\u2019m just saying \u2013 I literally believe that a bolt of lightning should hit the White House and light it on fire before it\u2019s handed over.\u201d   Jared Holt, a resident fellow at The Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab who studies US domestic extremist movements and had extensively researched January 6, said Alexander\u2019s rhetoric had the potential to influence bad behavior among the far-right.   \u201cHis role in the pro-Trump political space, connecting politicians, influencers, and activists, means that his words matter a great deal,\u201d Holt told CNN. \u201cWhat Alexander says, whether in jest or in earnest, has the potential to ripple across far-right communities and offer permission for bad behavior.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN's Gul Tuysuz and Eyad Kourdi contributed to this report.", "Fact check: Republican House leader Kevin McCarthy makes at least 5 false claims in 7-minute Fox News interview | CNN Politics": " House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy made at least five false claims during a seven-minute Sunday interview on Fox News.   McCarthy uttered inaccurate statements to host Maria Bartiromo about a wide variety of topics \u2013 oil prices, inflation, prisoners released in Afghanistan, the behavior of Democratic state legislators, and the content of an elections bill supported by congressional Democrats.   Here is a fact check.   Trying to liken President Joe Biden\u2019s tenure to the 1970s era of former President Jimmy Carter, which was beset by inflation and oil-related challenges, McCarthy claimed that oil prices are now \u201cthe highest that we have seen.\u201d   Facts First: McCarthy was wrong. Oil prices under Biden are not even close to the highest we have ever seen. Crude prices peaked in 2008 under Republican President George W. Bush \u2013 more than double their level at the time McCarthy\u2019s interview aired Sunday. Crude prices were also higher at various points under Republican President Donald Trump than they were on Sunday.   On the Friday before McCarthy made this claim, the price of benchmark Brent crude fell below $66 a barrel. That is less than half of the all-time high of more than $147 a barrel in 2008. Further, Brent crude was well above $66 a barrel at various points in 2018 and 2019 under Trump, briefly exceeding $84.   At under $63, West Texas Intermediate crude, a US benchmark, was also going Friday for less than half of its 2008 peak and for less than it did on various days under Trump; it briefly topped $75 under Trump. (The prices of both Brent and West Texas Intermediate increased early this week, after McCarthy\u2019s comments, but remained below their Trump-era highs, let alone their all-time highs.)   McCarthy could have correctly said that oil prices have spiked this year as global demand has rebounded from the pandemic lows of 2020. But he was plain incorrect to suggest that this year\u2019s prices are unprecedented. And, regardless, it\u2019s important to note that US presidents have a limited role in oil prices, which are governed by a complex global dance of supply and demand factors.   Tom Kloza, a longtime energy analyst with Oil Price Information Service, said that \u201cnothing that President Biden has done has had much impact\u201d on the current prices of either crude oil or gasoline. Kloza said this year\u2019s prices have been affected by a combination of supply \u201cdiscipline\u201d from the OPEC+ group of producer countries and \u201cthe unprecedented recovery in world oil demand.\u201d   McCarthy claimed that there is now \u201cinflation at a number we have not seen.\u201d He then described the Biden era as \u201cJimmy Carter on steroids.\u201d   Facts First: McCarthy was wrong again. While inflation was at a 13-year high in June and July, at a seasonally adjusted 5.3% on a year-over-year basis, it is not even close to the highest we have ever seen and not even close to the level of the late Carter era. Inflation was more than twice as high in every month of 1980 than it was in June and July of this year; its 1980 peak was 14.6%.   You don\u2019t have to go as far back as the Carter presidency to find inflation as high as that of June and July of this year. Inflation hit a slightly higher level, 5.5%, in July 2008, under Bush.   Inflation has also exceeded the current level at other points outside the Carter era. For example, it was above 7% for the entirety of 1974 and 1975, under Carter\u2019s Republican predecessors Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, peaking at 12.2% during that period.   It\u2019s important to note that current inflation is being caused at least in part by pandemic-related factors that might not last. Businesses that cut prices or kept them flat during the crisis of 2020 are raising them to conventional levels; consumers helped by federal relief funds have money to spend and have strong demand for many products; businesses are facing supply pressures from production shortages and shipping problems.   Whether or not inflation is temporary, though, it definitely isn\u2019t the highest we have seen.   Speaking about congressional Democrats, McCarthy asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they protecting the border from those 5,000 prisoners who have just left Afghanistan and \u2013 have the hope of coming across our borders?\u201d   Facts First: There is no basis for McCarthy\u2019s claim that 5,000 former prisoners have \u201cjust left Afghanistan\u201d with the hope of coming to the US. And McCarthy neglected to mention that it was President Donald Trump\u2019s own 2020 deal with the Taliban \u2013 a deal McCarthy had positive words about at the time \u2013 in which the US agreed to let up to 5,000 Afghan prisoners go free.   Colin Clarke, senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, a nonprofit that studies global security issues, said that \u201cUS officials at the airport who are screening and vetting those leaving Afghanistan are obviously not allowing prisoners released through the US-Taliban deal and through various prison breaks to board planes coming to the United States.\u201d Clarke said that he hasn\u2019t heard \u201canyone\u201d credibly suggest Taliban members are seeking to infiltrate the US through the Mexican border.   Anthony Cordesman, an Afghanistan expert and the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, called McCarthy\u2019s claim \u201cnonsense.\u201d Cordesman added: \u201cIf they left Afghanistan: to where? Pakistan? Because I doubt very much that they\u2019re in Canada, the Bahamas or Mexico.\u201d   Because we can\u2019t predict the future, we\u2019ll add a caveat. It\u2019s certainly possible that some former prisoners from Afghanistan will try to cross the US border at some point. But there\u2019s still no basis for McCarthy\u2019s suggestion of a current problem involving 5,000 former prisoners who \u201cjust left\u201d the country and are presently trying to figure out how to get into the US.   McCarthy\u2019s office did not respond to a request for an explanation of this claim or any of the others we address in this article.   After Bartiromo pressed McCarthy about making sure future elections are free and fair, and mentioned states that are changing their voting laws, McCarthy said, \u201cWe have watched state after state where Democrats have left the state. That is where the real difficulty lies. But now we have got them back into Texas.\u201d   Facts First: It\u2019s not true that Democrats have left \u201cstate after state\u201d to prevent Republicans from passing changes to voting laws. Texas is the only state whose Democratic legislators left the state under Biden or Trump to deny Republicans the minimum attendance needed to pass elections legislation.   It\u2019s possible that McCarthy was thinking of how dozens of Democratic lawmakers from other states came to Washington, DC this month to join the quorum-breaking Texas lawmakers. But those lawmakers, unlike the Texas group, didn\u2019t cause Republicans \u201creal difficulty\u201d in passing voting laws. In fact, many of the lawmakers were from states were Republicans had already passed new voting laws.   There have been a small number of Democratic walkouts over Republican elections proposals in years past, though not all of them involved legislators leaving the state. Texas Democrats fled to Oklahoma in 2003 over a Republican redistricting proposal. In 2001, Oregon Democrats went into hiding to deny quorum over a Republican redistricting effort there.   McCarthy said Democrats\u2019 new elections bill \u201cwould ban ID voting.\u201d (McCarthy was more explicit on Twitter on Tuesday, tweeting that the Democratic agenda is to \u201cban voter ID in every state.\u201d)   Facts First: It\u2019s not true that Democrats\u2019 elections bill would ban voter ID. Specifically, the Democratic bill would not prohibit states from having voter identification laws and would not prohibit states from checking the IDs of in-person voters. Rather, it would require states to give voters an alternative to showing the ID the states normally demand \u2013 specifically, to allow voters who do not show that ID to instead submit signed statements under penalty of perjury attesting to their identity and eligibility to vote.   Critics are entitled to argue that this provision of the Democratic bill would weaken or undermine the  voter ID laws of states with strict current requirements. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell has said, for example, that the bill would mean a \u201cneutering\u201d of voter ID laws.   But it\u2019s just not accurate to claim the bill is a total \u201cban\u201d on voter ID laws. The staunchly Republican state of Idaho allows voters who aren\u2019t able to present one of its required forms ID to cast a ballot after signing an affidavit attesting to their identity. Nobody could credibly argue that voter ID is banned in Idaho.   For absentee ballot applications in particular, the Democratic bill says that states can\u2019t require any form of identification except for a signature or \u201csimilar affirmation.\u201d It says, though, that this policy has \u201cno effect\u201d on ID requirements for first-time voters registering by mail. And as the National Conference of State Legislatures notes on its website, state voter ID requirements generally don\u2019t apply to mail-in or absentee ballots anyway.

Ha! What glass ceiling? Women, women exaggerate the problem of sexism,\u201d  radio host Larry Elder said in a 1996 ad for his radio show.   Then a hand slaps him across the face.   \u201cBlacks exaggerate the significance of racism,\u201d Elder adds. Another slap. \u201cMedicare should be abolished,\u201d he continues. Slap. With each new comment, a hand slaps Elder across his face.   \u201cWhat\u2019d I say?\u201d a grinning Elder asks as the ad concludes.   Elder has long relished making provocative comments in his time as a radio host and columnist. But now, what he previously said could complicate the Republican\u2019s campaign to win California\u2019s September 14 recall election and unseat sitting Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. His comments about women \u2013 which have already drawn attacks from his opponents \u2013 are coming under scrutiny. And a CNN KFile review of his comments, dating back to 1996, show a lengthy history.   The Elder campaign did not provide comment when CNN requested it.   He has mocked premenstrual syndrome, known as PMS, calling it \u201cPunish My Spouse (or Significant Other).\u201d He prominently promoted on his webpage a 1950s textbook on \u201chow to be a good wife\u201d that said women should \u201chave dinner ready\u201d and told them, \u201cDon\u2019t complain.\u201d He reposted an article on his website comparing single mothers on welfare to stray cats.   Elder has already faced some backlash for derogatory remarks he made about women in a 2000 column, in which he wrote that \u201cWomen know less than men about political issues, economics, and current events\u201d and claimed that this gave Democrats an edge over Republicans because \u201cthe less one knows, the easier the manipulation.\u201d   His disparaging comments have been as recent as January 2017, when he deleted a tweet that implied women taking part in the Women\u2019s March were too unattractive to be sexually assaulted, according to the Los Angeles Times.   In another previously unreported comment from a January 2017 radio show, Elder mocked women attending the Women\u2019s March as \u201cobese.\u201d   \u201cWhen you look at all these women that have marched \u2013 something like 2 million women \u2013 Donald Trump has probably gotten more obese woman off the couch and in the streets, working out, than Michelle Obama did in eight years,\u201d he said on an episode reviewed by CNN.   He even has challenged mainstream orthodoxy on subjects like violence against women.   In the early 2000s, Elder maintained a page on his personal website on \u201cwomen and domestic violence statistics,\u201d citing three articles that alleged a narrative that violence against women was exaggerated for political gain of feminists. One of the articles cited by Elder claimed the Violence Against Women Act, which was signed into law in 1994, was passed with the goal of \u201credistributing power from the ruling class (men) to the oppressed class (women).\u201d Another asked, \u201cWhy does our culture refuse to hold women as well as men accountable for their participation in domestic violence?\u201d   In his books, Elder endorsed pregnancy discrimination, according to a report from Media Matters, suggesting that working mothers aren\u2019t \u201cdedicated\u201d and available for an \u201call-hands-on-deck commitment\u201d to work.   \u201cWhen I saw those comments directed about women, directed about pregnancy discrimination, that\u2019s not right,\u201d former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, one of his Republican opponents, said about Elder following a debate Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not right for anybody of any political party or background.

Biden, along with First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden, addressed members of the US Olympic team via a livestreamed virtual reception.

The US team lost that game and later lost to Canada in the semifinals before taking the bronze.   Trump\u2019s comments Saturday echoed the statement he released Thursday, when the US women\u2019s soccer team won the bronze. Instead of praising this accomplishment, he reveled in the fact the team didn\u2019t win the gold: \u201cIf our soccer team, headed by a radical group of Leftist Maniacs, wasn\u2019t woke, they would have won the Gold Medal instead of the Bronze.\u201d   Apparently to Trump, you must support his views or you are deemed a \u201cwoke\u201d loser. Here we have a former President of the United States gleeful that a US Olympic team didn\u2019t win a gold medal because they don\u2019t share his politics.   Related article Simone Biles' Olympics took everyone by surprise   This is not the first time Trump has slammed athletes for bringing attention to systemic racism. For example, in 2017, Trump infamously slammed Black NFL players for taking a knee during the national anthem, calling them \u201csons of bitches\u201d and demanding they be \u201cfired.\u201d He has previously had run-ins with one of the leaders of the US Olympic women\u2019s soccer team, Megan Rapinoe, when in 2019 he told The Hill in an interview that it was inappropriate for her to take a knee during the national anthem before matches.   Overall, though, this is simply more of Trump reminding us that he only supports people who support him. When he was in the White House, Trump continually made us aware that he only cared about his base \u2013 while the rest of us were expendable. Nothing has changed with the man who lost the popular vote for President in 2016 and 2020.   This again is in sharp contrast to President Biden. At his presidential inauguration, just two weeks after Trump\u2019s Jan 6 insurrection, Biden promised that he wanted to be \u201cPresident for all Americans,\u201d adding, \u201cI will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did.\u201d   That\u2019s why during his talk to the Olympians on Saturday, Biden didn\u2019t tell them he only cheered for those who agreed with him politically. Biden is a real American President. He praised all the athletes, stating: \u201cYou handle yourself with such grace, and such decency, it just \u2013 you made me so damn proud.\u201d     The United States is constantly evolving \u2013 and our Olympic team reflects that. Our nation\u2019s first Olympic team in 1896 was comprised of 14 White men (sounds like a team Trump would\u2019ve have loved). Flash forward to our remarkably diverse team in Tokyo, which saw great success, winning the most medals of any country. And it was our nation\u2019s female Olympians who led our nation to success, taking home 66 medals of 113 won by Team USA.   Trump writes off swaths of this team as \u201cwoke.\u201d The rest of us see it how President Biden expressed it Saturday to the diverse group of athletes who make up our Olympic team: \u201cYou remind us of what an amazing country we are.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Vance called then-President a \u2018moral disaster\u2019 in 2017 messages | CNN Politics": " Ohio Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance, a venture capitalist and author of the bestselling book \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d disparaged then-President Donald Trump as a \u201cmoral disaster\u201d whose administration had \u201cno domestic policy agenda besides tax cuts\u201d in Twitter direct messages from summer 2017.   Vance made the comments, which were sent to a former friend from law school and obtained and verified by CNN\u2019s KFile, in the context of stating his opposition to the American Health Care Act \u2013 the Republican plan to replace Obamacare, which passed the House but not the Senate. Vance said he would attempt to personally lobby members of Congress to kill the bill.   \u201cCan you imagine running as an anti-AHCA populist who thinks Trump is a moral disaster,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cWhere\u2019s my constituency?\u201d   In other anti-Trump comments from 2016, 2017 and 2018 found by CNN\u2019s KFile in a review of Vance\u2019s media appearances, he agreed that then-candidate Trump was a fraud who he didn\u2019t think cared about people and said he might vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 if he really believed Trump could win.   \u201cI cannot stand Trump because I think he\u2019s a fraud. Well, I think he\u2019s a total fraud that is exploiting these people,\u201d Kentucky radio host Matt Jones said to Vance in August 2016.   \u201cI do too,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cI agree with you on Trump, because I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s the person. I don\u2019t think he actually cares about folks. I think he just recognizes that there was a hole in the conversation and that hole is that people from these regions of the country, they feel ignored. They feel left out and they feel very frustrated. And I think of course in a lot of ways they feel that way for totally justifiable reasons. So it\u2019s a problem that Trump has been the vessel of a lot of that frustration.\u201d   Vance entered the crowded primary to fill the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman in early July. The field already included former State Treasurer Josh Mandel, former Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken and businessmen Bernie Moreno and Mike Gibbons.   But after his announcement, Vance had to immediately apologize for now-deleted tweets sent in 2016, uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile, in which he disparaged Trump as \u201creprehensible\u201d and said he would be voting for third-party candidate Evan McMullin.   Vance declined to comment for this story.   In an interview with NPR in August 2016, Vance said he might even vote for Clinton.   \u201cI think there\u2019s a chance, if I feel like Trump has a really good chance of winning, that I might have to hold my nose and vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Vance said.   Trump\u2019s policies related to immigration were overly simplistic, Vance said in September 2016, citing Trump\u2019s message on building a wall on the southern US border.   \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d   After Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, Vance\u2019s public criticisms of Trump\u2019s moral behavior became less frequent, but he continued to criticize him on policy and predicted a scandal-ridden presidency.   \u201cI think we\u2019re in for quite a ride,\u201d Vance wrote in a since-deleted January 2017 tweet, available through the Internet Archive, when asked about potential scandals.   \u201cCan\u2019t be repeated enough,\u201d Vance added in February 2017 on the same day Trump spoke about America\u2019s trade policies. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about America\u2019s economic interest, focus more on automation/education than trade protectionism.\u201d   In January 2018, Vance announced that he would not seek to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in that year\u2019s election, saying that \u201cit\u2019s just not a good time\u201d and he had \u201cthought seriously about running in August 2017.\u201d   A month after his announcement, he still said he wasn\u2019t sure the Trump administration had long-term policies that would improve people\u2019s lives.   \u201cThe part that is forward-looking and answers the question \u2018What do we do now?\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s just not there yet,\u201d Vance told the Financial Times in February 2018, suggesting  Trump relied too much on standard Republican orthodoxy from the Reagan years.   But by 2019, Vance\u2019s views on Trump began to shift to be more publicly supportive of him on policy.   In June 2019, Vance said he thought Trump had been a \u201cwild success\u201d with his China and Middle East foreign policy. He said Trump completely transformed American policy regarding China by taking a harsher stance against the country and that, unlike former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Trump had avoided getting the US into any \u201cstupid\u201d wars in the Middle East.   Vance, however, was still critical of Republican health care legislation.   \u201cI think about the healthcare legislation, which I think was genuinely a moral and political disaster and I\u2019m glad that it never passed,\u201d he said.   In March 2021, before launching his Senate campaign, Vance publicly declared that his support for Trump was based on policy.   \u201cI didn\u2019t think the policy was going to be that good, and the policy was much better than I thought it was going to be,\u201d he told radio host Sebastian Gorka. \u201cI was really happy with the policy. And so, that\u2019s what caused me to become a Trump supporter.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Previously, the CDC said viral testing was appropriate for people with recent or suspected exposure, even if they were asymptomatic.   Related article CDC was pressured 'from the top down' to change coronavirus testing guidance, official says   Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who was previously Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner, said on CNN\u2019s New Day on Wednesday that the testing guideline changes make no sense.   \u201cThese are exactly the people who should be tested,\u201d Wen said, giving the example of a person exposed at work who wants a test so they can protect their family at home.   A senior federal health official close to the process tells CNN the sudden change in CDC Covid-19 testing guidance was the result of pressure from the Trump administration. When asked by CNN whether the CDC was responding to pressure from the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services, the senior official said, \u201cIt\u2019s coming from the top down.\u201d   Here\u2019s what the CDC website said previously: \u201cTesting is recommended for all close contacts of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, it is important that contacts of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection be quickly identified and tested.\u201d   Related article With major delays in Covid-19 testing, AMA and other medical groups push for testing priority guidelines   The CDC changed the site on Monday. Here\u2019s what it says now: \u201cIf you have been in close contact (within 6 feet) of a person with a COVID-19 infection for at least 15 minutes but do not have symptoms, you do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one.\u201d   Those who don\u2019t have Covid-19 symptoms and haven\u2019t been in close contact with someone with a known infection do not need a test, the updated guidelines say.   \u201cNot everyone needs to be tested,\u201d the agency\u2019s website says. \u201cIf you do get tested, you should self-quarantine/isolate at home pending test results and follow the advice of your health care provider or a public health professional.\u201d   The CDC guidelines say if someone has symptoms and they\u2019re mild, a health care provider \u201cmay advise a COVID-19 test,\u201d and if symptoms are severe, people should contact a health care provider or seek emergency care.   \u201cIt is important to realize that you can be infected and spread the virus but feel well and have no symptoms,\u201d the updated CDC site says, noting that local public health officials might request asymptomatic \u201chealthy people\u201d be tested, depending on cases and spread in an area.   In its pandemic planning scenarios, the CDC says its current best estimate is that 40% of infections are asymptomatic and 50% of transmission occur before symptoms occur.   Doctors were puzzled by the change and questioned why the CDC did not explain why it made the update.   CDC referred questions to HHS. In a statement provided Wednesday to CNN, HHS Assistant Secretary Dr. Brett Giroir said: \u201cThis Guidance has been updated to reflect current evidence and best public health practices, and to further emphasize using CDC-approved prevention strategies to protect yourself, your family, and the most vulnerable of all ages.\u201d   HHS has not specified what change in \u201ccurrent evidence\u201d may have driven the change.   The statement continued: \u201cThe updated Guidance places an emphasis on testing individuals with symptomatic illness, those with a significant exposure or for vulnerable populations, including residents and staff in nursing homes or long term care facilities, critical infrastructure workers, healthcare workers and first responders, and those individuals (who may be asymptomatic) when prioritized by public health officials.\u201d   Related article HHS directs CDC to put Covid-related hospital data back on its website   Wen, the former Baltimore health commissioner, said, \u201cI\u2019m concerned that these recommendations suggest someone who has had substantial exposure to a person with Covid-19 now doesn\u2019t need to get tested.\u201d   \u201cThis is key to contact tracing, especially given that up to 50% of all transmission is due to people who do not have symptoms. One wonders why these guidelines were changed \u2013 is it to justify continued deficit of testing?\u201d   Dr. Carlos del Rio, infectious disease specialist and associate dean of Emory University School of Medicine, told CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto on Wednesday that not testing may be OK in some circumstances \u2013 brief contact, for example.   \u201cBut if you have been in contact for 15 minutes and that people doesn\u2019t have a mask, I think you need to be tested regardless if you have symptoms or not,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know especially young people going into the house and then transmit inside the household. So, the guidelines baffle me and I really don\u2019t understand them.\u201d   Del Rio added that he\u2019s concerned about politics influencing these decisions. He noted that President Trump has said in the past that more testing leads to the detection of more cases.   Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.   \u201cI am worried that this is just a way to slow down testing and that would clearly be not good,\u201d deo Rio said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to decrease the amount of testing. We want to decrease cases by decreasing transmission, not by decreasing testing.\u201d   A spokesperson at the US Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday denied the change would affect contact tracing efforts, which most public health officials say is key to any eventual control of the virus. \u201cThe updated guidance does not undermine contact tracing or any other types of surveillance testing,\u201d the spokesperson said.   HHS said people should consult with their doctors or with local health officials to decide if they need to be tested.   \u201cThe guidance fully supports public health surveillance testing, done in a proactive way through federal, state, and local public health officials,\u201d the spokesperson said.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Greene, running now to represent in the northwest corner of Georgia in the US House, made the comments in 2017 and 2018, writing for the now-defunct website of American Truth Seekers, a conspiracy-laden blog.   In a Facebook post, Greene wrote that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was guilty of treason and suggested she could be executed.   Greene responded to CNN\u2019s report after publication, saying in a statement that she wears \u201cattacks\u201d from the media as a \u201cbadge of honor.\u201d She did not address the past blog posts in her response and did not respond to further request for comment.   American Truth Seekers\u2019s website stopped operating in 2019, but social media accounts and videos that link to Greene\u2019s time as a correspondent at the website are still online. The conservative blog spread conspiracy theories about QAnon and once questioned if the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was a \u201cmassive false flag.\u201d False flag attacks refer to acts that are designed by perpetrators to be made to look like they were carried out by other individuals or groups.   Greene is poised to be elected to Congress this fall after winning the primary in a conservative district. She has previously embraced QAnon, the false conspiracy theory that claims a \u201cdeep state\u201d is working to overthrow President Donald Trump and that the President has been secretly fighting to bring down a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles that has infiltrated the US government and other elite institutions.   Trump praised Greene as a \u201cfuture Republican Star\u201d and \u201ca real WINNER!\u201d in a tweet following her primary win despite Greene\u2019s ties to QAnon, which the FBI has labeled as a potential domestic terrorist threat. Greene tweeted on Tuesday that she had been invited to attend Trump\u2019s Republican convention speech at the White House on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m honored and thrilled,\u201d she wrote, attaching an image of an invitation.   Greene has subsequently backtracked on her embrace of the conspiracy, telling Fox News last week, \u201conce I started finding misinformation, I decided that I would choose another path.\u201d   But writing for \u201cAmerican Truth Seekers\u201d in a 2017 blog post, Greene spread other conspiracy theories, including that the deadly white supremacist rally held in 2017 in Charlottesville was an \u201cinside job\u201d to \u201cfurther the agenda of the elites.\u201d   Greene cited a blog post from Your News Wire, a website that spreads political misinformation and conspiracy theories, that quoted an anonymous police officer alleging the events at Charlottesville were engineered for a specific agenda.   Greene speculated that agenda included a \u201ccoordinated war\u201d by former President Barack Obama and other Democratic operatives to overthrow Trump from power.   \u201cWhat would be the agenda of the elites? Hmm.. Remember Barack Obama\u2019s roots are in community organizing. As a matter of fact that\u2019s about all he did before he became President. It\u2019s also been reported that Obama has an office set up in Washington DC that is being run like a war room, with daily meetings. What would they be up to?\u201d wrote Greene.   Greene also questioned whether the actions of the white nationalist who rammed his car into 19 people and killed one woman were intentional or not and said he may have done so out of fear.   \u201cWhether this is true or not, it is beyond tragic that James Alex Fields Jr rammed his car into the crowd killing 1 and injuring 19 others. If it was intentional and premeditated, then he deserves to be held accountable. Yet if his reaction was out of fear and hitting the crowd was actually an accident, then that changes the narrative of what happened in Charlottesville this past weekend,\u201d wrote Greene.   Fields was later convicted of first-degree murder and nine other charges, and he pleaded guilty to 29 federal hate crimes. He was sentenced to life in prison in both federal court and Virginia state courts, sentences he will serve consecutively.   NBC News first reported on some of Greene\u2019s writings for the American Truth Seekers blog, including her promotion of the \u201cClinton Kill List,\u201d a baseless conspiracy that alleges Hillary Clinton ordered assassinations on her associates.   In another post from 2017, Greene linked to a blog post from a conspiracy website that speculated that \u201cPizzagate\u201d\u2013 a debunked conspiracy theory from 2016 that claimed that the Clintons and Democratic operatives were running a pedophilia ring out of a pizzeria in Washington, DC \u2013 was real.   \u201cShockingly, the website tells about information that was only whispered about and called conspiracy theories by all main stream [sic] news media,\u201d Greene wrote, linking to the post that falsely claimed a DNC staffer was the source for Wikileaks.   \u201cYet when you go to the website, it tells as if Seth Rich is speaking from the dead saying all the horrible things are true. That Hillary rigged the election against Bernie Sanders. That John Podesta had him murdered. That John Podesta is a pedophile and pizza gate [sic] is real,\u201d Greene added in November 2017.   The Seth Rich conspiracy alleges that Rich, a 27-year-old DNC staffer murdered in the summer of 2016, was actually the target of an assassination ordered by Hillary Clinton and her allies, including John Podesta, because of the Russian-hacked DNC emails in 2016. Pizzagate and the Seth Rich conspiracies have been extensively debunked but continue to circulate in QAnon corners.   Greene has faced backlash among Republican leaders following a report in Politico that she made Islamophobic and bigoted remarks  on social media. Greene said Muslims do not belong in government and that there is \u201can Islamic invasion into our government offices.\u201d She said Black people \u201care held slaves to the Democratic Party\u201d and said she would feel \u201cproud\u201d to see a Confederate monument if she were black. She falsely called George Soros, a Jewish billionaire and Democratic megadonor, a Nazi.   In another previously unreported social media post, Greene called for Pelosi to be impeached for \u201ccrimes of treason,\u201d which she pointed out is \u201ca crime punishable by death,\u201d for supporting undocumented immigrants and not providing funding for Trump\u2019s southern border wall.

John Gibbs, the nominee, is currently the acting assistant secretary for community planning and development at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where he has worked for three years.   A CNN KFile review in 2018 of archived versions of Gibbs\u2019 Twitter feed showed he had spread a false conspiracy theory that claimed Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign chairman took part in a satanic ritual. Gibbs also defended an anti-Semitic Twitter user who had been banned from the platform, and made derogatory comments about Islam and the Democratic Party.   Gibbs\u2019 Twitter feed has been set to private since 2017 and the few tweets archived and accessible to public view offer only a small glimpse of his activity on social media.   Gibbs is a former conservative commentator and software engineer who initially joined HUD as the director for the Strong Cities, Strong Communities initiative. In August of 2017, he transitioned to the role of senior adviser, working in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, and is now an acting assistant secretary.   OPM manages the government\u2019s workforce, serving as a human resources department for civilian employees.   Gibbs\u2019 nomination comes as the White House aggressively moves to install loyalists across the government in key positions.   Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, defended Gibbs\u2019 nomination in an email to CNN.   \u201cInstead of highlighting Mr. Gibbs\u2019 work to increase economic development programs for low-income people or his successful deployment for more than $9 billion in CARES Act funds to respond to COVID-19, the media would rather dwell on some nonsense from 2016,\u201d Deere wrote.   A spokesperson for the Democratic minority on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs said the past comments raised concerns.   \u201cThese reports raise serious concerns that should be discussed during the nomination process. Ranking Member Peters will thoroughly evaluate the record and qualifications of any nominee that comes before the committee,\u201d the spokesperson said, referring to Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat.   Aaron Jacobs, a spokesperson for Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, another Democrat on the committee, also raised concerns about Gibbs.   \u201cSen. Hassan has serious concerns about Mr. Gibbs\u2019s nomination to lead the Office of Personnel Management,\u201d Jacobs told CNN in an email.   On Twitter, Gibbs made multiple references to a conspiracy theory started by far-right bloggers that claimed Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta took part in a satanic ritual. The claim has repeatedly been debunked.   Tweets from Gibbs, archived on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, show him promoting the conspiracy four times between October 31 and November 5 of 2016, using the hashtag #SpiritCooking.   The hashtag originated from an email of Podesta\u2019s released by WikiLeaks, which members of the far right claimed without evidence meant that Podesta was involved in some sort of satanic ritual.   When radio host Wayne Dupree, who has spread Sandy Hook school shooting hoax stories, tweeted that Clinton was losing Black support because her campaign manager took part in \u201cSatanic #SpiritCooking,\u201d Gibbs quote tweeted him, writing, \u201cTrue, true, and true. #Trump #SpiritCooking #BlackLivesMatter.\u201d   In tweets from early 2016, Gibbs  also blasted \u201ccucks,\u201d a derogatory term used by the far right to insult establishment conservatives, and derided the Democratic Party for accepting Islam.   In a tweet from October 2016, Gibbs defended Ricky Vaughn, an alt-right figure who often tweeted anti-Semitic sentiments and was banned by Twitter.   \u201c#Twitter down big today because they banned Ricky? #FreeRicky,\u201d he wrote.

Facts First: The words \u201cpigs in a blanket, fry \u2018em like bacon\u201d were chanted at a protest march held by a Black Lives Matter group in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 2015. That group, however, was an independent entity not affiliated with the national Black Lives Matter organization. And we could find no evidence the chant has been used by the national organization, by any Black Lives Matter groups in the New York City area, or by Black Lives Matter activists anywhere outside Minnesota \u2013 nor even by the St. Paul group on any subsequent occasion.   Since there have been hundreds of events at least loosely connected with the sprawling Black Lives Matter movement, we can\u2019t say for certain that the chant has never been used by any Black Lives Matter protester at any moment since the Minnesota incident.   But it is safe to say that the chant is not an official, national or prominent Black Lives Matter slogan.   A group of protesters was filmed chanting the words \u201cpigs in a blanket, fry \u2018em like bacon\u201d during an August 29, 2015, march to the grounds of the Minnesota State Fair. The march had been organized by the independent Black Lives Matter group in St. Paul, Minnesota.   A police field supervisor who was escorting the group responded to the chant by commenting that everybody likes bacon.   But others in law enforcement were not amused. The St. Paul police union denounced the chant as disgusting, with then-president Dave Titus saying it was \u201cbasically promoting killing police officers.\u201d Through a spokesperson, Minnesota\u2019s then-Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, called the chant \u201ca terrible thing to say.\u201d   Rashad Turner, a founder of the St. Paul Black Lives Matter group, said at the time that \u201cno one is promoting violence.\u201d Turner told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that the chant \u2013 which lasted about 30 seconds, according to a person who filmed it \u2013 was simply a demand for police officers who kill people to be treated the same as civilians who kill people.   It did not \u201cmean literally \u2018fry these guys\u2019 or \u2018kill them\u2019 or anything like that,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that a cop can kill someone, be seen on camera doing that, be charged or indicted with murder, and be able to post bail. \u2026 What we are promoting is that if Black people who kill police officers are going to fry, then we want police officers to face the same treatment that we face as civilians for killing officers.\u201d   Regardless of whether you believe Turner\u2019s explanation, there is no indication that the chant spread to other Black Lives Matter events, was ever used as any kind of official slogan, or even that it was a common chant among the St. Paul activists.   Turner, who is now executive director of the Minnesota Parent Union, told CNN via Twitter on Wednesday that the group used the chant \u201cjust that one time.\u201d And our search of newspaper articles and television coverage (specifically, coverage by major networks whose closed captions are preserved on Archive.org) did not find examples of the chant from any protest events other than the Minnesota march.   So how did Trump remember a five-year-old controversy?   We don\u2019t know for sure. But it\u2019s possible, perhaps likely, that that he had been watching some of his favorite Fox News shows.   Fox hosts have talked about the Minnesota chant on numerous occasions in the years since 2015 as they have raised suspicions about Black Lives Matter \u2013 and both Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson played the video of the chant in June of this year, before Trump\u2019s tweets.   Carlson ran the video the week before Trump\u2019s first tweet using the phrase on June 25.   To understand this controversy, it\u2019s helpful to understand that the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d can refer to several different things.   It\u2019s a statement of principle anyone can make. It\u2019s the informal name of a broad movement opposing police brutality and other racism against Black people. It\u2019s also the name of an incorporated organization that has a network of official local chapters.   And, still more, it is the name of numerous independent groups dedicated to similar goals but not affiliated with the organization. Anyone can start a group that includes the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d   That\u2019s what happened in St. Paul. Contrary to McEnany\u2019s suggestion that the group that did the chant in 2015 was part of the \u201corganization,\u201d news accounts from 2015 show that it was an independent entity at the time.   Turner confirmed this to CNN in a message on Thursday. He said the group never became an official chapter.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The comments come from Merritt Corrigan, the recently appointed deputy White House liaison at the US Agency for International Development, in tweets in 2019 and 2020. CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed 400 previously unreported tweets from Corrigan\u2019s feed, which were captured by the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine.   Corrigan previously worked at Hungary\u2019s Embassy in the US where she repeatedly tweeted support for far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, calling him \u201cthe shining champion of Western civilization,\u201d according to ProPublica, which reported on several of Corrigan\u2019s tweets on June 5.   Axios reported Wednesday that USAID employee groups requested to meet with John Barsa, the acting administrator of USAID, over concerns about Corrigan and several other recent appointees. On June 8, Barsa defended Corrigan and two other appointees with a history of anti-LGBTQ and anti-Muslim remarks, saying in a statement articles on their comments were \u201cunwarranted and malicious attacks.\u201d   \u201cI have full confidence that each political appointee at USAID has and will continue to implement the President\u2019s policies and agenda to the best of his or her ability,\u201d Barsa said.   USAID spokesperson Pooja Jhunjhunwala also told Axios on Wednesday: \u201cAA Barsa received this letter on Monday, June 22. He will meet with the Employee Resource Group representatives and plans to continue the conversation on the issues mentioned.\u201d   Jhunjhunwala declined to comment further on Monday and pointed CNN\u2019s KFile to her past statements. In response to ProPublica\u2019s report, she said USAID had a \u201czero-tolerance policy of any form of discrimination or harassment based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion or any other possible distinguishing characteristic that can define any of us.\u201d   Corrigan did not respond to multiple CNN requests for comment.   \u201cMass deportations when?,\u201d Corrigan tweeted in October 2019, linking to a 2010 article in which German Chancellor Angela Merkel said German multiculturalism has failed. (A picture of the article was not captured in the tweet, but a link can be viewed in the WebArchive\u2019s source code of the tweet.)   Corrigan frequently criticized notions of gender equality and feminism for running counter to her view that women were primarily mothers and wives and belonged in the home.   In response to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren making a statement in support of same-sex marriage during a Democratic presidential townhall, Corrigan said women shouldn\u2019t be in office.   \u201cThis sick statement by Warren, which glibly mocks a real crisis happening in our society, is exactly why women shouldn\u2019t be in office. They will always advocate for themselves at the expense of men, and revel in it,\u201d she tweeted in October 2019.   In another tweet from October, Corrigan attacked a conservative radio host Michael Knowles for sharing a photo of himself with a drag queen.   \u201cRight wing gatekeepers have made it abundantly clear that their allegiance is to Satan and those who carry out his agenda of appalling sexual perversion over those who question the liberal status quo,\u201d she tweeted.   Her expressed views run counter to USAID\u2019s mission statement that LGBTQ people have a right \u201cto live with dignity, free from discrimination, persecution, and violence.\u201d   In other tweets, Corrigan repeatedly expressed support for far-right anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim European political parties like the National Front in France and AfD in Germany.   Corrigan repeatedly expressed hostility towards refugees and immigration, both in the United States and in Europe.   In response to a report on improved conditions in Somalia, Corrigan wrote in October 2019, \u201cGreat, can we send the 70,000+ Somalis in Minnesota back then?\u201d   Later, in the same month, she said, \u201cImmigration is the hostile governing elite\u2019s preferred agent of chaos.\u201d   In another pair of tweets she added, \u201cAmerica has no moral imperative to accept immigrants,\u201d and said that \u201cculture is just as relevant if not more\u201d than economics to merit-based immigration. In another tweet, she cheered the United Nations reporting a deficit of $230 million saying, \u201cNo more money to promote eternal third world immigration.\u201d   Also in October 2019, Corrigan tweeted support for the far-right Germany political party AfD, an anti-immigration and anti-Muslim group.   \u201cAfD continues to grow nationally. Perhaps the Germans are awakening to the fact that they don\u2019t want to live in a country where Eritrean migrants push their children in front of trains,\u201d she wrote.   Following a report that a sword-wielding man killed one and injured nine in Finland, she demanded to know if he was an immigrant. Reports described the suspect as a native Finn born in 1994.   She also blamed immigration for a rise in violent crime in Britain, writing in November 2019, \u201cNever forget that violent crime in your neighborhood is little more than an \u2018electoral headache\u2019 for the political elite that supported the immigration policies responsible for it.\u201d   In another tweet from November, Corrigan mocked conservatives who said Hispanics were \u201cnatural conservatives.\u201d Corrigan was responding to a racist tweet that spoke of a hypothetical situation in which a \u201cgroup of black and latino youths\u201d were beating people and suggested \u201crelevant racial crime data\u201d should be used in crafting immigration policies.   Corrigan repeatedly shared multiple tweets critical of the LGBTQ community and the growing societal trend towards tolerance.   In October 2019, she shared a Breitbart article which reported that anti-transgender ads bolster Republican turnout in elections, and said, \u201cWe have to speak out now about the transsexual agenda before it becomes normalized.\u201d   Later, in the same month, she linked the acceptance for LGBTQ teens was related to an increase in teen suicides and also mocked former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is gay, for pretending to be in a \u201creal marriage.\u201d   Corrigan was particularly critical of conservatives who embraced LGBTQ people, writing in October 2019, \u201cThe morally bankrupt GOP must be held accountable for its total capitulation to, and tacit endorsement of, the gay agenda.\u201d   In another instance she mocked conservative tolerance of gay people writing, \u201cThe conservative case for just throwing in the towel and embracing globohomo.\u201d   In October 2019, Corrigan called for establishing a \u201cChristian patriarchy,\u201d and when another user compared her belief to Shariah law, she said her worldview was a \u201cdignified and respectful way of organizing society.\u201d   Later that month, she wrote in response to a tweet from far-right commentator Peter Sweden, \u201cWestern women are slowly waking up to the lies of feminism and the organized effort to push us toward an empty life of isolation and childlessness.\u201d   In November 2019, she said that \u201cfemale empowerment is a civilizational calamity and a Trojan horse for corporate interests.\u201d Later that month, she said that \u201cbirth control is an evil tool that has been used to systematically manipulate women into believing casual sex doesn\u2019t hurt them as long as don\u2019t get pregnant.\u201d   Also in November 2019, she wrote multiple tweets arguing that it was cruel and wrong to \u201cempower\u201d girls and tell them they are \u201cequal\u201d to men.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

The new spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services in a series of now-deleted tweets made racist and derogatory comments about Chinese people, said Democrats wanted the coronavirus to kill millions of people and accused the media of intentionally creating panic around the pandemic to hurt President Donald Trump.   Michael Caputo, a longtime New York Republican political operative who worked on Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, was appointed last week as Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at HHS, a prominent communications role at the department which serves a central role in the federal government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic.   Caputo, a prolific user who often tweeted insults and profanity, recently erased nearly his entire Twitter history from before April 12. CNN\u2019s KFile used the Internet Archive\u2019s \u201cThe Wayback Machine\u201d to review more than 1300 deleted tweets and retweets from late February to early April many of which were regarding the rapidly spreading coronavirus.   While he occasionally weighed in with praise for public officials or more straightforward observations, tweets from this period are also littered with conspiracy theories and controversial language to go after perceived critics of the Trump administration.   In a series of tweets on March 12, Caputo responded to a baseless conspiracy theory that the United States brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, China, by tweeting that \u201cmillions of Chinese suck the blood out of rabid bats as an appetizer and eat the ass out of anteaters.\u201d   He followed up at another user, \u201cDon\u2019t you have a bat to eat?\u201d and tweeted at another user, \u201cYou\u2019re very convincing, Wang.\u201d   \u2022 December 31, 2019: China reports mysterious pneumonia cases to the World Health Organization.\u2022 January 7, 2020: China says the cases were caused by a new coronavirus.\u2022 January 17: US starts screening for symptoms at certain airports.\u2022 January 21: First US case confirmed in Washington state.\u2022 January 31: US says it will deny entry to foreign nationals who\u2019ve traveled in China in the last 14 days.\u2022 February 6: A person in California\u2019s Santa Clara County dies of coronavirus; link not confirmed until April 21.\u2022 February 17: A second person in California\u2019s Santa Clara County dies of coronavirus; link not confirmed until April 21.\u2022 February 26: CDC announces what\u2019s then thought to be the first possible US case of community spread, in California.\u2022 February 29: A patient dies of coronavirus in Washington state \u2013 then believed to be the country\u2019s first novel coronavirus death.   After publication, Caputo responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment by saying that reporting on his past tweets is \u201cfair game, dude. I don\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t matter to me at all.\u201d He claimed that he deletes his tweets \u201cevery month and I do it because it drives people mad.\u201d   He added \u201cwhen you tweet in spirited fashion, KFile is going to have them. I\u2019ve known that all my days. So I don\u2019t mind what you\u2019ve done.\u201d Caputo defended his past Twitter behavior saying he was \u201ca defender of the President\u201d tweeting in a \u201cspirited manner\u201d that included calling out reporters, but he said he\u2019s \u201cnow a servant of the American people and some might be disappointed, but my tweets will be different.\u201d   Spokespeople for HHS did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the White House declined to comment.   Caputo also used his Twitter account to aggressively attack Democrats and the media.   In March, he referred to one White House reporter as \u201ca dick\u201d after that reporter had a heated exchange with the President. He said many Americans viewed reporters as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d for \u201ccarrying water for the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d He implied that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough was guilty of sedition.   On March 8, he said a Democrat may try to inflict hundreds of thousands of American deaths from the coronavirus, creating a hypothetical scenario comparable to James Hodgkinson, the anti-Trump man who shot House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise and four others during a Republican congressional baseball game practice in 2017.   \u201cCoronavirus is the Democrats\u2019 new Russia, their new Ukraine. And nobody will believe them except their zombies. But know this: The Dems\u2019 strategy to defeat @realDonaldTrump requires 100s of thousands of American deaths. Will one of their nutjobs make it happen, a la Hodgkinson?\u201d   That same day, Caputo retweeted conservative actor Nick Searcy saying, \u201cDemocrats are pulling for the virus to kill a lot of people.\u201d   In other tweets from March, Caputo claimed the media created \u201cintentional\u201d panic created around the outbreak, saying it was \u201corchestrated by soulless Trump critics who seize every crisis as an opportunity to stop him.\u201d   Caputo is a friend of political operative and Trump associate Roger Stone, leading a campaign to have Stone pardoned after he was found guilty of lying to Congress, obstructing a congressional inquiry and witness tampering after Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation brought charges against him. He was sentenced to 40 months in prison in February.   Caputo was also interviewed by Mueller prosecutors and testified before Congress, and adamantly denied there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.   Caputo resigned from the 2016 Trump campaign after he tweeted \u201cDing Dong the witch is dead\u201d following the news that its campaign manager Corey Lewandowski had been fired.   Here are some of Caputo\u2019s deleted tweets pertaining to the unfolding health crisis in the United States:   February 28: Caputo tweets, \u201cBottom line, a lot of Americans have to get sick and die for coronavirus to tank the Trump economy. The Democrats\u2019 only hope for 2020 victory is a sunk economy. They\u2019re talking it down right now. But their strategy only works if a lot of Americans get sick and die.\u201d   March 8: Caputo tweets, \u201cCoronavirus is the Democrats\u2019 new Russia, their new Ukraine. And nobody will believe them except their zombies. But know this: The Dems\u2019 strategy to defeat @realDonaldTrump requires 100s of thousands of American deaths. Will one of their nutjobs make it happen, a la Hodgkinson?\u201d   March 8: Caputo retweets a tweet from the conservative actor Nick Searcy that read, \u201cDemocrats are pulling for the virus to kill a lot of people.\u201d   March 8: Caputo tweets a screenshot of a Washington Post story, \u201cHow the Trump administration lost control of the coronavirus crisis.\u201d \u201cThe Get Trump Media has shifted gears again: from the Russia Hoax to the Ukraine hoax to this. REMEMBER: Coronavirus is serious. The media is not.\u201d   March 11: Caputo tweets in a chain on testing shortages, \u201cA lot of the panic is orchestrated by soulless Trump critics who seize every crisis as an opportunity to stop him. And fail.\u201d Still, Caputo acknowledged that the lack of testing was an issue.   March 11: Caputo tweets, \u201cFor the Democrat 2020 victory strategy to work, 100,000+ Americans have to die. For the Democrat 2020 victory strategy to work, you have to believe the media. Media literacy is more vital now than ever. Question everything - smell the BS - start by doubting anonymous sources.\u201d   He follows up in a tweet saying, \u201cThere must be a national pandemic tragedy for the Democrats to win. They\u2019re counting on it now.\u201d   March 12: Caputo tweets in response to the baseless conspiracy that the US brought coronavirus to Wuhan that, \u201cSure, millions of Chinese suck the blood out of rabid bats as an appetizer and eat the ass out of anteaters but some foreigner snuck in a bottle of the good stuff. That\u2019s it.\u201d He follows up, \u201cDon\u2019t you have a bat to eat?\u201d He tweets at another user, \u201cYou\u2019re very convincing, Wang.\u201d   March 13: Caputo tweets that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is an \u201c*asshat.\u201d   March 14: Caputo tweets, \u201c100s of thousands must die and the US economy must collapse for the Democrat 2020 victory strategy to succeed. They\u2019re getting so excited for the carnage. Sick people.\u201d   He follows up, \u201cOf course he has\u201d \u2013 in response to Trump being proactive. \u201cThis Democrat strategy, echoed by their conjugal media, will fail. Hoping your country fails and hundreds of thousands die so you can gain power is a sick and twisted strategy. America will punish them.\u201d   March 14: Caputo tweets, \u201cTaking down names of progs who pick out of context phrases from Administration statements so they can \u2018LOL\u2019 for resistance cred while Washington deals with a pandemic. These are the biggest assholes. Hugest shitbags. Gargantuan sphincters.\u201d   March 15: Caputo tweets a reference to a conspiracy about George Soros, the prominent philanthropist and Democratic donor. \u201cAre you kidding? Soros\u2019s political agenda REQUIRES a pandemic.\u201d Soros is the subject of numerous anti-Semitic conspiracy theories fueled by extremists and in 2018 a pipe bomb was sent to his home in New York state.   March 15: Caputo tweets at Daniel Goldman, a lawyer for House Democrats during impeachment, \u201cWow. I started out feeling badly for you. At least now we know the Wuhan Virus doesn\u2019t have any lingering effects on douchebags.\u201d   Goldman had tested positive for coronavirus and had tweeted, \u201cOne final note: I may be the first you know who tested positive, but I won\u2019t be the last. Let\u2019s take care of each other, listen to the experts and the cities, states and corporations who are taking the lead in the absence of the fed government, and get through this together. END.\u201d   March 16: Caputo tweets in response to a tweet noting the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost all its gains since Trump took office, \u201cThe Democrat celebration of the death and destruction will be held soon.\u201d   March 17: Caputo tweets, \u201c#ChineseVirus\u201d 20 times in a row. President Trump in March began calling the coronavirus the \u201cChinese virus.\u201d   Trump claimed he did so to counter conspiracy theories from Chinese media and an official that the US brought the coronavirus to Wuhan. Trump claimed he also did so because it was \u201caccurate\u2026 it comes from China, that\u2019s why.\u201d Trump denied that it is a racist term. Critics alleged the President did so to deflect blame from his own administration\u2019s preparation failures. Trump subsequently decided to pull back from associating the coronavirus\u2019 name with China.   March 17: Caputo tweets, \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party has always been adept at lying to cover their murders. What\u2019s remarkable here is the US Democrats and their conjugal media repeating CCP propaganda because they hate Trump more than they love America. The Wuhan virus has exposed them.\u201d   March 17: Caputo tweets claiming there is \u201cintentional media panic.\u201d   \u201cSaying the intentional media panic doesn\u2019t exist is dishonest. Saying everything in this crisis transpires because of intentional media panic is also dishonest,\u201d writes Caputo.   March 17: Caputo tweets a conspiracy that implies economist David Rothschild is a member of the European Rothschild family calling him, \u201can inbred elitist sphincter whose family craves control. That\u2019s one reason why he constantly lies about President Trump.\u201d   Rothschild told CNN he is not related to the banking family, which is frequently the target of anti-Semitic conspiracies.   March 18: Caputo tweets, \u201cDouble down on #ChineseVirus. Leftists lost the true meaning of \u2018racism\u2019 long ago.  And polls show they\u2019ve beaten this dead horse so badly that GOP, independent, and soft Dem voters ignore them.\u201d He adds, \u201cNobody should let Democrats and their conjugal media popularize Chinese Communist Party talking points. Democrats + Media = CCP.\u201d   March 18: Caputo tweets after a reporter asks Trump why he calls it the \u201cChinese Virus,\u201d \u201cAnd they wonder why many consider them now the enemy of the people. Carrying water for the Chinese Communist Party is reason enough.\u201d   March 20: Caputo tweets at Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut to, \u201cTry to support America until this is over. Even you can do it.\u201d Murphy had tweeted complaints about how long it would take to receive the order of facemasks, blaming the Trump administration. Murphy cited a February 5 tweet he sent after a Congressional briefing saying the Trump administration was not taking coronavirus \u201cseriously enough.\u201d   March 20: Caputo tweets at another Twitter user, \u201cI know you want millions to die so your addled candidate can stumble into the White House but it looks like you might be disappointed. How sad for you.\u201d Caputo had sent a tweet that cited a report from Fox News to claim Washington was flattening the pandemic curve and the Twitter user had asked for a link to the information.   March 20: After President Trump ripped into NBC News reporter Peter Alexander for asking Trump what he had to say to Americans who were scared of the virus, Caputo criticized the media for defending Alexander: \u201cthe media is showing their asses to the world again, wringing their hands over a hack reporter\u2019s treatment.\u201d   When one of Caputo\u2019s followers pushed back and said that his question was legitimate, Caputo responded by saying, \u201cListen to his entire interaction including his first comment/question. Also: this guy has been a dick for awhile.\u201d   Alexander began his exchange with Trump by asking whether he was giving Americans \u201cfalse hope\u201d by promoting unproven coronavirus drugs.   March 20: Caputo tweets in an exchange on Hollywood elite, \u201cThey understand the Chinese authorities caused this global crisis, but they hate Pres Trump more than they love America. Anyone who once doubted that now knows its true.\u201d   March 21: Caputo sends a tweet that implies MSNBC host Scarborough is committing treason, \u201c300M? That\u2019s just foolish. As our nation is in crisis you\u2019re working hard to make the situation worse. There\u2019s a word for that. Do you know it? It rhymes with sedition.\u201d Scarborough tweeted about a lack of testing for 300 million Americans.   Scarborough told CNN in an email, \u201cI\u2019m more interested in what the assistant Secretary does in the future than what he may have tweeted about me in the past. We\u2019re facing difficult times ahead and I am hopeful that the president\u2019s entire team will  simply follow the lead of Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and keep America\u2019s seniors safe.\u201d   March 21: Caputo tweets at Gen. Michael Hayden, former CIA and NSA director for George W. Bush, \u201cYou are corrupt garbage, Hayden. Spying on Americans is insidious and illegal, but you normalized it. Now you defend China after they unleashed a global pandemic. You can fuck right off. Step aside and let normal Americans do the right thing. Your time is gone.\u201d   Hayden had called Richard Grenell, the acting DNI director, an \u201cidiot\u201d after Grenell tweeted, \u201cThe one who started the fire should never be praised for acting like a firefighter later\u201d in reference to China\u2019s role in the coronavirus pandemic.

With this House action, they get closer to their goal and they think they can cover their flank with \u2018argle bargle corporations get rich!\u2019 Normal Americans see this and will punish them.\u201d   Caputo follows up, \u201cI\u2019m serious: The Dem strategy for 2020 victory requires that @realDonaldTrump fail in his fight against the Chinese virus.Failure is measured in deaths and economic collapse. The only questions to ask a Dem are how many Americans must die, how many families must be destroyed?\u201d   March 22: Caputo quote tweets a user, adding he is \u201cright you know\u201d to say Democrats hope no treatment for coronavirus works. \u201cThey are literally cheering on the deaths of Americans and the destruction of our economy. They would rather see people die than see Trump successfully navigate this disaster,\u201d the tweet said.   \u201cHow many Americans must die to feed Democrat powerlust? 100K? 1M? More??,\u201d Caputo added. \u201cHow much economic destruction is the Democrat goal? 100% unemployment?\u2019\u201d   March 23: Caputo tweets with a picture of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the debate over the economic stimulus package, \u201cThe Democrats have one motivation for holding Americans hostage in a global crisis: HATE.\u201d   March 27: Caputo retweets a picture of a smiling George Soros with the caption, \u201cThe real virus!\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f behind everything\u2026..\u201d   March 28: Caputo tweets. \u201cThis is how mentally ill many Trump haters are in this crisis\u201d in reply to a tweet that says Trump supporters will \u201cignore scientific and medical experts\u201d  and \u201curge millions to die for the glory of capitalism.\u201d   March 28: Caputo quote tweets MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes, who noted no other country on Earth was doing a worse job handling the crisis, with \u201cWho knew @chrislhayes is Chinese?\u201d   March 29: Caputo tweets that Vice President Joe Biden is an \u201cempty puppet\u201d and Ron Klain, the former Ebola czar in the Obama administration, is a \u201cpuppeteer\u201d for the \u201cCCP [Chinese Communist Party] virus\u201d, writing, \u201cYou don\u2019t see it?

In radio and television appearances, McEnany, in her role as spokeswoman for President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, said the administration had the rapidly spreading coronavirus \u201cunder control\u201d and said that because of travel restrictions enacted by the President, \u201cwe will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here.\u201d   She also said Democrats were \u201cactively rooting against what\u2019s in the best interest of America,\u201d including rooting for coronavirus to take hold. She said coronavirus, like the Russia and Ukraine scandals, was being used to take down Trump.   CNN reported on Tuesday  that McEnany, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign who previously served as CNN contributor during the 2016 campaign, will replace Stephanie Grisham as White House press secretary.   The Trump administration is facing continued scrutiny over its preparations for the coronavirus pandemic, its slow response to provide states and cities assistance in testing kits and personal protective equipment, and comments from the President and top White House officials downplaying the virus.   McEnany did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.   Speaking on Fox Business on February 25, McEnany said because of travel policies enacted by the President, coronavirus would not continue to come to the United States.   \u201cThis President will always put America first,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will always protect American citizens. We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here. We will not see terrorism come here. And isn\u2019t that refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama?\u201d   McEnany defended her comments over the weekend in a series of tweets, saying, \u201cContext matters, I was asked about travel restrictions and stated the intent of those restrictions.\u201d   Speaking on Fox Business a day later on February 26, McEnany said the President had coronavirus under control.   \u201cThe President\u2019s taking control, making sure we\u2019re safe from the coronavirus,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s doing everything right.\u201d   McEnany sharply criticized Democrats critical of the White House\u2019s response to coronavirus, saying they were rooting for coronavirus and the stock market to tank.   \u201cWhat is so sick to me is that what is good for America, rather what is bad for America, is good for Democrats,\u201d McEnany told Fox News on February 28.   \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that they think this way,\u201d she said. \u201cThey root against the stock market. They root for this to take hold. They have a demented dream of taking down President Trump. It doesn\u2019t matter how many Americans they destroy in order to get there.\u201d   In March, McEnany continued to defend the president as the outbreak spread. On local Michigan radio on March 10, she said it was incumbent on the public to take adequate political health measures but the situation was under control.   \u201cThis is something that is under control,\u201d she said on the Frank Beckmann Show. \u201cWe have a President who has taken unprecedented action and mandatory quarantines and travel restrictions, and he\u2019s taken every measure that he possibly could to protect the American people. I\u2019m confident we have a great leader at the top, but it\u2019s incumbent upon all of us just to take those precautions.\u201d   On March 11 on the Pat Miller Show, an Indiana local radio program, she accused Democrats and the media of rooting for a recession she said was not coming, adding the President kept the outbreak from being worse.   \u201cThey\u2019re trying to politicize it. At times it seems they\u2019re actively rooting against what\u2019s in the best interest of America,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen them how many times root against the stock market doing well. You had the media saying, \u2018There\u2019s an inverted yield curve.\u2019 This was a few months ago, therefore a recession. Oh, RV sales are down, therefore a recession. Oh, coronavirus \u2013 we\u2019re heading toward a recession. It\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re rooting for this outcome, which is sick and would obviously economically devastate the lives of the American people.\u201d   \u201cThey try to score cheap political points,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this all along. The coronavirus is just one example. They tried it with Russia, with Ukraine. It\u2019s whatever they can come up with to try to take this President down. Which isn\u2019t just about the President. It\u2019s about taking down the vote of the American people. That\u2019s ultimately what this is.\u201d   \u201cThis President\u2019s taken unprecedented action to protect this country from the coronavirus,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe stopped it from being so much worse than it could have been, but leave it to the media and the left to score those cheap political points.\u201d   McEnany also defended the President from criticism he had come under for saying he\u2019d continue to hold rallies, saying the President was the best authority on when to cancel events. Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden earlier had both announced the cancellation of planned rallies in Ohio. In one interview, McEnany said Biden was doing it just to get off the campaign trial.   \u201cAs he said before in this business, in politics you\u2019re expected to shake hands and we do,\u201d she said on the Chris Stigall Show. \u2018So I bring Purell around with me. I just take precautions and been lucky to be happy and healthy. And we have a president who\u2019s a commander in chief who\u2019s taken great, unprecedented action to keep this nation safe. It would be a whole lot worse had he not put in place those travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines.\u201d   McEnany added that rallies were \u201cproceeding as normal.\u201d Asked what she would say to critics who said that continuing to hold rallies was \u201chighly irresponsible\u201d McEnany said the president said it was safe.   \u201cI\u2019d say that the President says this is safe,\u201d she said.   \u201cDr. Fauci has said it depends on the location,\u201d she continued, referring to National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re not having it in a hot spot where there\u2019s a big outbreak like outside of New York for instance and it\u2019s safe to proceed. So, you know, as long as the experts say it continues to be safe, then we follow that lead and we will proceed as normal. And you\u2019ll take precautions as I said, but not panic because we have a president leading on this.\u201d   The same day, in a contentious interview on Fox Business with Stuart Varney, McEnany was confronted by the news of Fauci saying on Capitol Hill there should be no large crowds   Varney said \u201cDr. Fauci, who is also testifying on Capitol Hill, he just said there should be no large crowds. He said it.\u201d   \u201cLook, we have the commander-in-chief, we have the best health experts, we\u2019re taking this day by day, we\u2019re currently proceeding as normal and look,\u201d she said. \u201cJoe Biden, he\u2019s suspending his rallies. Well, he\u2019s been dying to get off the campaign trail. The man can only speak for seven minutes.\u201d   \u201cLook, the President is the best authority on this issue,\u201d she added. \u201cHe takes into consult the words of everyone around him. That would include (Health and Human Services Secretary) Alex Azar, that would include Dr. Fauci, that would include others. So I\u2019ll leave it to the president. Right now we\u2019re proceeding as normal.\u201d   CNN\u2019s Em Steck contributed reporting.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.   The Trump-Fox News feedback loop \u2013 where President Donald Trump gets ideas from Fox News or the network gets its talking points from Trump \u2013 has been with us for years. The goal has always been the same: Help the President at all costs.   Potentially the most disturbing example of this unholy alliance has come recently regarding the deadly coronavirus. Some (not all) Fox News hosts, along with Trump, have spewed misleading information about the risks posed by Covid-19, making it hard to determine who was leading whom. For example, in late February, various Fox News hosts framed the Democrats\u2019 criticism of Trump\u2019s then handling of the outbreak as simply another attempt to hurt Trump politically.   Trump\u2019s chief cheerleader Sean Hannity, on his February 27 show, did note that the \u201crapid spread\u201d of the coronavirus was \u201cconcerning.\u201d But Hannity gave his political spin, slamming \u201csome on the left\u201d for \u201cliterally whipping this country into a frenzy,\u201d as he claimed that Democrats were \u201csadly politicizing and weaponizing an infectious disease as their next effort to bludgeon President Trump.\u201d   Related article Donald Trump's supreme challenge   Unsurprisingly, the very next night, Trump downplayed the threat of the coronavirus at a rally, instead going on the attack and, like Fox News, claiming the Democrats \u201care politicizing the coronavirus.\u201d The President then ticked off what he views as the Democrats\u2019 other attempts to take him down which he has deemed in the past \u201choaxes,\u201d from \u201cRussia\u201d to \u201cimpeachment\u201d then adding, \u201cand this is their new hoax.\u201d   We also saw Fox News hosts follow Trump\u2019s lead in undermining the danger posed by the coronavirus as being no more dangerous than the seasonal flu. Trump stated that point-blank on February 26, saying, \u201cThis is like a flu,\u201d at a White House news conference. It comes as no surprise that soon Fox News hosts were making the same claim, such as Jeanine Pirro declaring on the March 7 edition of her show, \u201call the talk about coronavirus being so much deadlier doesn\u2019t reflect reality.\u201d Pirro argued that the flu would be much more deadly if not for the fact that we have a vaccine against it. She was pushing for a vaccine against Covid-19, although experts say it won\u2019t be ready for many months.   Related article Trump put American lives in China's hands   But given that even Trump has recently declared that the virus could result in between 100,000 to 240,000 Americans dying, the pro-Trump network hosts have lately been less about undermining the threat of the virus. Instead, Trump\u2019s Fox News media allies Hannity and Tucker Carlson appear to have pivoted to defending Trump from political fallout over the federal government\u2019s inability to provide states with desperately needed medical supplies and the economic consequences of shutting down large swaths of America in the absence of a robust national testing and tracing program to stem the virus\u2019 spread.   For example, in response to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s criticism that Trump has not provided New York with life-saving ventilators, Hannity took to his show on March 27 and slammed Cuomo for \u201cwhining, bitching and constant complaining\u201d about the lack of such equipment. Hannity even falsely proclaimed that, \u201cEverything that New York will need, Cuomo has requested, the President has delivered.\u201d Obviously that\u2019s not accurate as Cuomo the very next day on March 28, and countless times since, noted the lack of ventilators and other medical supplies.   On Saturday Hannity penned an op-ed for Fox News again slamming Cuomo, this time blaming him for not spending money years ago to buy ventilators.   Related article The wartime president who Trump should learn from   There\u2019s little doubt that Trump would wholly support Hannity\u2019s attacks on Cuomo. In fact, during Saturday\u2019s White House press briefing, Trump went after Cuomo claiming the he has not been \u201cgracious,\u201d given that the Trump administration has \u201cgiven the governor of New York more than anybody has ever been given in a long time.\u201d   The fact New York has received so much assistance from the federal government is obviously because the state has by far the most cases of coronavirus in America \u2013 but to Trump doing the right thing demands that a governor be grateful to him.   Then there\u2019s Tucker Carlson who, unlike Hannity, did use his Fox News show to sound alarm bells about the deadliness of the coronavirus beginning on March 9, in a monologue that reportedly influenced Trump to take the threat of the virus more seriously.     But now Carlson appears to either be trying to make Dr. Anthony Fauci a scapegoat for our economic downturn \u2013 thus giving Trump political cover \u2013 or persuade Trump to ignore the advice of this world-renowned doctor. On his show Friday, Carlson attacked Fauci\u2019s call to shut down America for long periods to stop the spread of the virus as being \u201cnational suicide.\u201d Carlson went on to criticize Fauci by stating, \u201cFauci is not an economist \u2013 or for that matter, someone who fears being unemployed.\u201d Carlson added that, \u201cWe should never let someone like that run the country.\u201d   Given Carlson\u2019s monologue Friday, it\u2019s no surprise that come Saturday\u2019s press conference Trump echoed his impatience with keeping the country closed, saying \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be doing this for months and months and months.\u201d This just moments after he warned that America\u2019s \u201ctoughest week\u201d of the coronavirus crisis was upon us, predicting \u201cthere will be death.\u201d   It\u2019s impossible to know where Trump stops and Fox News begins or vice versa. But what\u2019s abundantly clear is that both have one common interest: Defend Trump at all costs \u2013 even if that means undermining doctors and lying about a deadly virus that is killing our fellow Americans.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

When PBS\u2019s Yamiche Alcindor noted that the President had said he did not believe that governors actually need all the equipment they claimed they did, Trump said, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that\u201d \u2014 even though he said precisely that on Fox News on Thursday.   Later, when CNN White House Correspondent Jeremy Diamond noted that Trump had said he wanted governors to be \u201cappreciative\u201d of him, and that \u201cif they don\u2019t treat you right, I don\u2019t call,\u201d Trump said, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t say that\u201d \u2014 even though he said precisely that at the Friday briefing.   Here\u2019s a closer look.   Trump falsely denied that he claimed governors from certain states are asking for equipment they don\u2019t need. At Sunday\u2019s briefing, Alcindor, Newshour\u2019s White House Correspondent, asked the President whether he felt his comments and belief \u201cthat some of the equipment that governors are requesting they don\u2019t actually need\u201d would have an impact on the federal distribution of ventilators and other medical resources. As Alcindor attempted to finish her question, the President interjected, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d before going on to say it wouldn\u2019t have an impact.   At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN\u2019s home for Facts First.   Facts First: He did say that. On March 26 during a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity, Trump said, \u201ca lot of equipment\u2019s being asked for that I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll need\u201d specifically in reference to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and following a tirade against Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.   Trump later said he felt Cuomo was requesting an unnecessary number of ventilators. \u201cI have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they are going to be,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.\u201d   When Alcindor noted that she was quoting from the President\u2019s interview with Hannity, Trump said: \u201cTake a look at my interview. What I want to do is if there is something wrong, we have to get to the bottom of it.\u201d   CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond began a question to Trump as follows: \u201cI\u2019d also like to ask you about some comments you made on Friday. You were talking about governors of different states and you said, \u2018I want them to be appreciative.\u2019 You also said, \u2018if they don\u2019t treat you right, I don\u2019t call.\u2019\u201d After Diamond said the words \u201cif they don\u2019t treat you right,\u201d Trump said, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d When Diamond finished the sentence, Trump said \u201cI didn\u2019t say that\u201d once more.   Facts First: Trump did say what he claimed he didn\u2019t. As Diamond told Trump, Diamond was reading direct quotes from Trump\u2019s Friday briefing. Trump went on to argue Sunday that he was being taken out of context, noting that on Friday he had also said of his \u201cI want them to be appreciative\u201d comment, that he was talking about people other than himself.   Trump had said Friday: \u201cI\u2019m not talking about me. I\u2019m talking about Mike Pence, the task force; I\u2019m talking about FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers.\u201d Trump is within his rights to urge media outlets to play the full clip, but those additional comments do not change the fact that he had said exactly what Diamond said he did.   Trump also said Sunday: \u201cI don\u2019t call the governor of Washington now, but Mike Pence calls, and the head of FEMA calls; I don\u2019t stop them. Did I ever ask you to do anything negative, Mike, to Washington?\u201d We don\u2019t know for sure what Trump might have told Pence in private, but Trump explicitly said Friday that he had indeed tried to get Pence not to call the governors of Washington and Michigan. Trump said Friday: \u201cHe calls all the governors. I tell him \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m a different type of person \u2014 I say, \u2018Mike, don\u2019t call the governor of Washington. You\u2019re wasting your time with him. Don\u2019t call the woman in Michigan.\u2019\u201d When a reporter pressed Trump on Friday about whether he really doesn\u2019t want Pence to call the governor of Washington, Trump confirmed \u2014 but said that Pence, a \u201cdifferent type of person,\u201d will \u201ccall quietly anyway.\u201d   Trump also repeated an exaggeration that he\u2019s made in the past on a topic unrelated to the pandemic.   Trump said, \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day when a general came and said, \u2018Sir\u2019 \u2013 my first week in office \u2013 \u2018we have no ammunition.\u2019 \u201d He repeated this claim later in the briefing without citing the general, claiming that the US had \u201cno ammunition\u201d before he had taken action.   Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. We don\u2019t know what a general might have told him in private, but it\u2019s not true that the US had \u201cno ammunition\u201d at the beginning of his presidency. Rather, according to the public comments of military leaders, there was a shortfall in certain kinds of munitions, particularly precision-guided bombs, late in the Obama presidency and early in the Trump presidency.

Dan Patrick is a fiery conservative who is no stranger to controversy.   Patrick, who has been lieutenant governor since 2015, has a history of polarizing rhetoric. A provocative conservative radio talk show host before he ran for office, Patrick has backed policies ranging from requiring people to use restrooms that match their assigned genders to the building of a wall along the US-Mexico border.   \u201cHe was Tea Party before the Tea Party even really existed,\u201d said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston.   Patrick\u2019s latest stirring came Monday, when he made comments that people should head back to work, even as officials nationwide shut down businesses in an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus.   \u201cMy message is that let\u2019s get back to work, let\u2019s get back to living. Let\u2019s be smart about it, and those of us who are 70-plus, we\u2019ll take care of ourselves, but don\u2019t sacrifice the country,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson.   In comments that echoed a growing desire among some Republicans, including President Donald Trump, to ease emergency guidelines, he suggested that he was willing to \u201ctake a chance\u201d to get the economy rolling.   \u201cWhat I\u2019m living in fear of is what\u2019s happening to this country,\u201d Patrick, who is about to turn 70, said. \u201cAnd you know, Tucker, no one reached out to me and said as a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren? And if that\u2019s the exchange, I\u2019m all in.\u201d   The comments on coronavirus and the economy, Jones said, were \u201ca little over the top, even for Dan Patrick.\u201d   Patrick\u2019s career began in sports broadcast in the 1970s. He then became a restaurateur in the 1980s and went bankrupt, eventually leading to his time as a provocative conservative radio talk show host.   Patrick\u2019s radio show was an early outlet for Rush Limbaugh before Limbaugh became one of the most prominent political radio hosts in the nation, Jones said.   \u201cI loved this little old station, and a guy named Rush Limbaugh called one day. I can detect a good, conservative voice when I hear it, so I put Rush on the radio in \u201988,\u201d Patrick told State Legislatures magazine in 2016.   Once, in August 1991, Patrick underwent a vasectomy live on his radio show, broadcasting from his urologist\u2019s office to encourage other men to consider the procedure, according to United Press International. Patrick\u2019s wife watched the procedure.   When he first ran for office in 2006, the Texas Observer called Patrick \u201cHouston\u2019s king of right-wing talk radio\u201d and reported that he was one to beat in a four-person Republican primary for a Texas Senate seat.   Patrick went on to handily win the primary and the seat itself in the general. He then served in the state Senate for eight years.   While in the state Senate, Patrick proposed a bill that would have restricted Transportation Security Administration pat-downs and \u201cmade it illegal for anyone conducting searches to touch private parts under or through clothing,\u201d according to local television station KHOU. The bill failed in 2011 after federal officials warned they would have to cancel flights in and out of Texas airports due to security concerns, KHOU reported.   Patrick was asked about the bill by CNN\u2019s Don Lemon at the time.   \u201cThomas Jefferson was very clear. He said resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions he wishes that it always be kept alive,\u201d he told Lemon. \u201cWell, it\u2019s being kept alive on this occasion because this is important that we speak up and say to the federal government, \u2018You just can\u2019t pass any rule that you want and expect the American public to take it.\u2019\u201d   Patrick spent much of time in the state Senate talking about ways to lower taxes. Before running for office, he was a founder of a group called Citizens Lowering Our Unfair Taxes that organized thousands of people in an effort to lower property taxes.   In 2002, Patrick published the book, \u201cThe Second Most Important Book You Will Ever Read: a Personal Challenge to Read the Bible.\u201d He later authored a bill that got the words, \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d displayed in the Senate chamber.   Later, when Patrick ran for lieutenant governor 2014, he framed his campaign around slowing immigration and controlling the border. Patrick has likened immigration into Texas to an invasion, and accused immigrants of bringing diseases.   \u201cDan Patrick was Donald Trump before Donald Trump was,\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, a professor of political science at the University of Houston.   Patrick defeated the three-time incumbent in the GOP primary and won an easy general election victory.   As lieutenant governor, he has backed a series of controversial policies. He was a leading proponent of the 2017 Texas \u201cbathroom bill.\u201d The bill did not become law, but would have required people to use school restrooms and facilities that match the gender on their birth certificates. It was opposed by transgender advocates and major Texas companies.   Patrick has also backed Trump\u2019s wall on the US-Mexico border.   Rottinghaus said Patrick is \u201cby nature a political bomb thrower.\u201d   He compared Patrick to Trump: \u201cThe stylistic similarities are pretty strong, and the political similarities in some ways are identical.\u201d   That parallel has been on display as Patrick campaigns for Trump\u2019s re-election.   \u201cWe did not have an election in 2016. We had a revolt!\u201d Patrick said when introducing Trump at a rally last year in Dallas, according to Texas Monthly. \u201cAnd this is what the media doesn\u2019t understand, or the progressive left. The revolution is only getting louder and larger!\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Klobuchar, running under the motto of \u201csafe streets, real consequences,\u201d made these issues the cornerstone of her campaign for Hennepin County Attorney. At the time, both Democrats and Republicans at the local and national level endorsed harsh punishments in the theory that it would deter future criminals.   Today, most Democrats, including Klobuchar, have distanced themselves from these policies, saying they were unnecessarily cruel and disproportionately harmed communities of color. Polls routinely show overwhelming public support for criminal justice reform, with a 2017 poll commissioned by the ACLU showing that 91% of Americans think the criminal justice system has problems that need fixing, and the majority of people in both parties supporting policies to reduce mandatory minimum sentencing and lower the prison population. Klobuchar voted for the First Step Act in 2018, an overwhelmingly bipartisan piece of criminal justice legislation which rolled back some tough-on-crime measures.   Earlier in the Democratic presidential primary, former Vice President Joe Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris had to answer criticism from the progressive wing of the party for their tough-on-crime past  \u2013 Biden for helping write the 1994 crime bill as a Delaware senator and Harris for her career as California\u2019s attorney general and San Francisco district attorney.   Klobuchar\u2019s own prosecutorial career has received some coverage, but records from her first political run for office show how she made tough-on-crime policies a key part of her rhetoric and campaign.   Klobuchar\u2019s campaign released a statement to CNN, defending her role as county attorney.   \u201cAmy Klobuchar ran on a community-oriented reform agenda for the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office. Her campaign focused on reducing gun violence and supporting anti-NRA gun safety reforms, supporting a drug court process that increased treatment and reduced drug use, and ensuring attorneys and personnel at the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office reflected the community\u2019s diversity.\u201d   In her presidential campaign, Klobuchar has talked about the need for changing the criminal justice system.   \u201cThere is racism in our criminal justice system and we need to take action to fight it,\u201d Klobuchar wrote in an April op-ed for CNN, adding that \u201cour criminal justice system cannot lose sight of the principles of fairness and compassion \u2013 for victims, yes, but also for offenders.\u201d   A CNN KFile review of Klobuchar\u2019s public statements and campaign materials during her 1998 race shows she advocated for strict punishment for juvenile offenders.   \u201cKids who commit violent acts must be made to understand the harm they cause and must receive appropriate punishment,\u201d Klobuchar wrote in a series of policy papers on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. \u201cThe response to violent crime must be particularly swift in juvenile cases. If we wait too long, the punishment attached to the crime will be lost on the juvenile as it will be too remote in time.\u201d   She also said that she would try to get courts to try violent juvenile offenders as adults rather than children.   In her campaign, Klobuchar praised the \u201cbroken-windows theory\u201d of policing which asserts that low-level property crime, such as vandalism and graffiti, leads to more serious violent crime by fostering an atmosphere of disorder which promotes criminality. The theory has been criticized for disproportionately impacting minority communities. The idea was conceived in the 1980s by social scientists, but became popular in the 1990s under then New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who embraced it and had the city\u2019s police department enforce it, establishing a model that other high-crime cities and municipalities across the country also embraced.   \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard again and again is that no crime is a small crime and that we must enforce the law down the line \u2013 as has been done so successfully in other parts of the country that have witnessed dramatic reductions in crime \u2013 in order to make the criminal justice system work for us,\u201d Klobuchar wrote.   In one section of her archived website titled \u201cCriminal Justice Reform,\u201d Klobuchar argued for \u201cmore trials, more convictions,\u201d and said that she would implement tougher plea negotiations between prosecutors and suspects. Klobuchar recognized that this would lead to significantly more criminal trials, which she encouraged.   \u201cI would expect that the implementation of my tough plea negotiation standards will result in prosecutors trying more cases before juries. The average number of trials per year per lawyer should be at least two to three times the current average.\u201d   In a policy paper, Klobuchar wrote that she would \u201cseek to hold judges more accountable by monitoring the sentences they impose.\u201d Though she didn\u2019t clarify how she would hold the judges accountable, criminal justice reform advocates argue that punishing judges for not dispensing harsh enough punishments leads to a chilling effect wherein harsh convictions become the only acceptable ruling. Klobuchar said she would also appeal lenient sentences.   In drug cases, Klobuchar wrote, minor offenders should get treatment, but adequate punishment. Still, she said, in many cases the drug offenders should be treated in prison, with the minor offenders getting second chances.   \u201cIf a defendant lands in court because of an addiction, that addiction should by all means be treated,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut if a defendant lands in court because of greed and drug dealing on our street corners for money, our response must be prison. In many instances, public safety requires that drug offenders get treated in prison rather than in the community at-large. Only minor offenders who earn it should be given a second chance.\u201d   Klobuchar\u2019s Republican opponent in the race was Sheryl Ramstad Hvass, who was previously a county judge.   Both Klobuchar and Hvass campaigned on tough-on-crime policies, though the Star Tribune newspaper endorsed Klobuchar because it said she had distinguished herself by emphasizing detail and clarity in her proposals, as well as her commitment to increase efficiency by eliminating bureaucratic barriers between departments.   Klobuchar narrowly won the election by less than 1%, and as county attorney she did more aggressively pursue non-violent crime such as graffiti, and drug cases, though she pursued some progressive measures as well, such as having prosecutors work more closely with local communities and worked with the Innocence Project to prevent wrongful convictions.   Klobuchar ran for reelection unopposed in 2002, before successfully running for Senate in 2006.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans \u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network.", "Fact check: Trump made 40 false claims | CNN Politics": " President Donald Trump\u2019s final campaign rally of 2019 was not only his longest ever but his most dishonest too.   Trump made 81 false claims in the week running from December 16 to December 22. He made almost half of them, 40, at his December 18 rally in Battle Creek, Michigan on the night he was impeached \u2013 a wild affair in which he spoke for two hours and one minute, nearly 20 minutes longer than his previous longest rally speech.   Related article Fact-checking Trump (and others) at CPAC   Trump\u2019s dishonesty at the rally ran the gamut of subjects \u2013 from impeachment to the size of his crowds to how far Battle Creek residents need to drive to dispose of their fluorescent light bulbs.   Trump\u2019s previous record for false claims in a rally speech was 36, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in 2018. His record for any kind of speech, 60 false claims, came in his longest address of any kind, an epic of two hours and two minutes at the Conservative Political Action Conference in March.   Trump\u2019s total of 81 false claims the week of the rally was tied for the fifth-highest weekly total of the 25 weeks we have tracked at CNN since July 8.   Trump made just nine false claims in the week from December 23 through December 29, the lowest of any week we have counted. Trump has been in Florida since December 20, and he has made few public remarks and had little on his public schedule since a 15-false-claim speech to conservative student group Turning Point USA on December 21.   Trump made 1,540 false claims between July 8 and December 29, about nine per day.   The most egregious false claim: Dishwasher dishonesty   Okay, it sounds kind of comedic when the President of the United States complains extremely inaccurately about dishwashers. But as we explained when we called this the most notable Trump lie of December, it\u2019s also serious stuff. Trump is using his false claim that modern dishwashers require more water and electricity than older dishwashers to try to sell an effort to weaken efficiency standards.   There is some possibility he is very confused rather than intentionally deceitful. But that would still be bad.   The most revealing false claim: Military planes   Trump makes false claims not only when trying to deceive low-information voters but when talking to people who are experts in the subject he is being inaccurate about.   During a Christmas Eve teleconference with members of the military, Trump told them that three years ago, before he was President, they had to use old planes, but that \u201cnow you have all brand new.\u201d   Members of the military are well aware of how wrong this is. As of late 2017, the average age of an Air Force plane was 28.3 years. Trump\u2019s administration has continued to order new planes since then, but \u201call brand new\u201d remains false.   The most absurd false claim: The war on Christmas   Having promised in 2015 and 2016 that every store would use the phrase \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d again when he became President rather than \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d \u2013 since, according to him, \u201cYou don\u2019t ever see the word \u2018Christmas\u2019 anymore\u2019\u201d \u2013 Trump, naturally, claimed this December that all department stores are now saying \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d again.   That is false. Just as it was false when he said they had all stopped referring to Christmas in the first place.   Here is the full list of 90 false claims from December 14 through December 27, starting with the ones we haven\u2019t previously included in one of these roundups:   Democrats and steel   Trump said of Democrats: \u201cThey want to close up your steel mills. They don\u2019t want your steel mills.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: There may be some Democrats somewhere who want to shut down American steel mills, but this is not true of the party generally or of its leading presidential candidates.   Former Vice President Joe Biden, the leader in national polls of the Democratic presidential primary, says the federal government should use tariffs on low-cost \u201cdumped\u201d foreign steel in an effort to protect domestic steel producers. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is promising to create \u201cunion, family-wage jobs\u201d in steel manufacturing. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has criticized the Trump administration for how it has granted exemptions to Trump\u2019s own steel tariffs \u2013 complaining that the administration\u2019s acts have undermined American steel producers. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is calling for \u201cnet-zero emissions from industry, including steel and concrete, manufacturing, and agriculture sectors,\u201d by 2050 \u2013 so environmental improvements in steel production, not the end of steel production.   Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims   Trump mocked journalists for calling it \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d when he says Joe Biden had told Ukrainian officials he would \u201crefuse to give $1 billion of taxpayer money to Ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your son\u2019s company.\u201d Trump said, \u201cHe\u2019s on tape. He\u2019s \u2013 if that were me, it\u2019s the electric chair. They would bring the electric chair back. No, the guy\u2019s on tape and they always say it\u2019s unsubstantiated.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are unsubstantiated \u2013 at best. There is no evidence Biden ever tried to get a Ukrainian prosecutor to stop investigating Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company where his son, Hunter Biden, had sat on the board of directors.   Rather, Joe Biden \u2013 carrying out the policy of the US government and its European allies \u2013 threatened to deny a $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine unless it fired a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was widely seen as corrupt or ineffective; there is no sign Biden tried to thwart the Burisma case. Also, there is no evidence Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation. And it is not even clear that Shokin was carrying out the investigation into Burisma or its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, at the time Joe Biden applied the pressure; Shokin\u2019s former deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, has said that the investigation was dormant at the time: \u201cThere was no pressure from anyone from the US to close cases against Zlochevsky. It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.\u201d   Joe Biden is \u201con tape\u201d at a 2018 event telling the story of how he pushed for Shokin\u2019s firing, not \u201con tape\u201d admitting he tried to stop any investigation or to help his son.   Biden\u2019s crowds   \u201cSo Biden has this rally, like you know, they got 200 seats \u2013 but only a small number of people. So you know what they do? They set up a roundtable. So think of these people. They come in, they think they\u2019re gonna listen to the speech; they end up sitting at a roundtable, discussing. They must have been happy, right?\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: We could not find any cases in which Biden was supposed to make a campaign speech but drew so few attendees that his campaign roped the people who did come into having a roundtable discussion with him instead. The Biden campaign told us this did not happen; the Trump campaign did not respond to a request to identify the event Trump was talking about.   Democrats and refugees   \u201cEvery Democrat running for president wants to open the floodgates to unlimited refugees from all around the world, overwhelming your communities and putting our national security at grave risk.\u201d  \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Democratic presidential candidates do want to allow in a greater number of refugees than Trump has \u2013 Trump has set a cap of 18,000 refugees for the current fiscal year, a historic low \u2013 but it is not true that all of the candidates are proposing to allow \u201cunlimited refugees.\u201d   For example, Biden calls for \u201crestoring refugee admissions in line with our historic practice under both Democratic and Republican Administrations\u201d; his website says, \u201cHe will set the annual global refugee admissions cap to 125,000, and seek to raise it over time commensurate with our responsibility, our values, and the unprecedented global need.\u201d Warren wrote in July, \u201cI\u2019ll welcome 125,000 refugees in my first year, and ramping up to at least 175,000 refugees per year by the end of my first term.\u201d   Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 plan says he would \u201clift President Trump\u2019s refugee caps\u201d and does not include a specific desired number of refugees \u2013 Sanders\u2019 campaign did not respond to a request for comment \u2013 so it is possible to argue that Sanders is calling for \u201cunlimited refugees.\u201d But that is not true of the entire field.   Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton and Michigan   Trump said that, on the last day of the 2016 election, \u201cHillary, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Bill Clinton \u2013 they did an emergency trip. They did an emergency trip to Michigan at 6 o\u2019clock.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton did not go to Michigan for Hillary Clinton\u2019s rally in the state on the last day of the campaign, nor for President Barack Obama\u2019s rally in the state that day. Both Bill Clinton, who campaigned in North Carolina that day, and Michelle Obama joined Hillary Clinton, along with Barack Obama, at a nighttime rally in Philadelphia.   Hillary Clinton\u2019s final crowd in Michigan   Trump said that, at Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cemergency\u201d rally in Michigan the day before the election, \u201cShe had 500 people.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Clinton had a capacity crowd of more than 4,000 people for her rally at Grand Valley State University, according to local media reports at the time. Grand Rapids\u2019 Wood TV8 reported: \u201cIn addition to the about 4,600 inside the Fieldhouse for Clinton\u2019s speech, there was an overflow crowd of several hundred more outside. People lined up hours beforehand to attend Clinton\u2019s 4 p.m. rally.\u201d   This was not a one-time slip; Trump has repeatedly put Clinton\u2019s crowd at \u201c500.\u201d   An unfair \u201ctrial\u201d   \u201cPelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the U.S. Congress\u2026\u201d \u2013 December 23 tweet   Facts First: The House did not hold a \u201ctrial\u201d at all. Under the Constitution, it is the Senate that has the sole power to try impeachments.   This is not merely a matter of semantics. During the House impeachment process, Republicans complained that Trump was being denied constitutional rights afforded to criminal defendants \u2013 wrongly suggesting to the public that the House process was tantamount to a trial.   The Constitution and impeachment   \u201cWorse still, I have been deprived of basic Constitutional Due Process from the beginning of this impeachment scam right up until the present.  I have been denied the most fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution, including the right to present evidence, to have my own counsel present, to confront accusers, and to call and cross-examine witnesses\u2026\u201d \u2013 December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi   Facts First: The constitutional rights of criminal defendants do not apply to public officials in a House of Representatives impeachment process, though Trump is free to argue that they should. Trump\u2019s counsel was denied the opportunity to participate in House Intelligence Committee impeachment hearings but was invited to participate in House Judiciary Committee hearings; Trump\u2019s counsel declined that opportunity. House Republicans were allowed to have their lawyer question witnesses at the House Intelligence Committee.   The crowd in Battle Creek   Trump referred to people standing in the crowd, then added, \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t get you seats \u2013 we didn\u2019t have any room. And by the way, 20,000 people outside had to leave. You know it\u2019s so cold outside we tell them, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about a screen. Go home, go home and watch.\u2019\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: We do not know the exact number of Trump supporters who were stuck outside because they were unable to get into his rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, but it was nowhere close to \u201c20,000.\u201d (Trump has long exaggerated the number of people stuck outside his events.)   Battle Creek city spokesperson Jessica VanderKolk said in an email that the city\u2019s \u201cbest guess\u201d was that there were \u201cabout 1,000 people who were not allowed inside once the arena reached capacity.\u201d Eric Greene, a former journalist and managing editor of the Battle Creek Enquirer newspaper who now works in public relations, wrote on Twitter: \u201cTrump just said there were 20,000 people who had to leave because they couldn\u2019t fit in the arena. This is blatantly FALSE. I know because I was outside the arena at the moment they closed the doors at approximately 5:45 p.m. At that time, a few hundred people quietly walked away.\u201d   The Battle Creek arena had a capacity of about 5,500 for the Trump event, according to the city and local media. Brooks Hepp, a current Enquirer reporter, said in an email that he did not see the size of the overflow crowd at its peak, but he said \u201cthe overflow area could not hold anywhere near 20,000 people, so that number is likely inaccurate.\u201d He said he would offer a rough guess of \u201cprobably 2,000-3,000 people at its peak and 1,000 by the time Trump started his speech.\u201d   People leaving Trump rallies   Trump said nobody ever leaves his rally speeches: \u201cI know they\u2019re coming back, nobody ever leaves our speeches. Because is there a better place to be in the world than a Trump rally? Never. Nobody.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: This is simply not true. People have been seen leaving multiple Trump rally speeches before he has finished speaking \u2013 including this very speech. The New York Times reported that \u201cas the speech went on, supporters began leaving in significant numbers or in some cases, appeared to doze off in their seats.\u201d Michigan television station WKZO reported: \u201cSome supporters started to leave early as the rally ran past 9:45 p.m.\u201d   Trump\u2019s venues   \u201cI\u2019ve had crowds over the last couple of weeks \u2013 we went to different, Pennsylvania, Florida, but \u2013 I mean, thousands and thousands of people can\u2019t get into these, you know, NBA arenas, right, big arenas. And we set records at every one, because we use the floor\u2026But we use the floor, right, the basketball court. So we set records at every arena. They never even mentioned the crowds. They never mention the crowds, it\u2019s sort of amazing.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Trump does sometimes hold rallies at NBA arenas, or at least NBA-sized arenas, but many of his venues are much smaller than that. Even when he has spoken in actual NBA arenas, it is not true that he has set a record every time. And it\u2019s not true that the media never mentions his crowds. To the contrary, his crowds are a regular subject of media attention.   Before he spoke at this Battle Creek, Michigan venue with an approximate capacity of 5,500 people, he spoke at a Hershey, Pennsylvania venue with an approximate capacity of 10,500; neither of them was an NBA venue. His venue before that was an NBA-sized venue in Sunrise, Florida \u2013 the home of the Florida Panthers NHL team, with an approximate capacity of 20,000.   Trump does not set an attendance record each time he holds a rally in an NBA arena. The last actual NBA arena he spoke in was the American Airlines Center in Dallas. Jason Evans, a spokesman for the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department, told CNN that the fire department and the arena calculated an attendance of 18,500. The Dallas Mavericks, who play in the arena, had an average announced attendance of 20,013 per game last season, among the highest in the NBA, according to ESPN data.   It is obviously false that the media never even mentions Trump\u2019s crowds. The response of the crowd to his rhetoric is a regular part of media coverage of his rallies; media outlets regularly mention when a rally venue was filled to capacity; their stories regularly include quotes from people in the crowd.   Trade with Europe   Speaking of \u201cEurope\u201d supposedly taking advantage of the US on trade, Trump said, \u201cThey don\u2019t take your product. They don\u2019t take your cars. They don\u2019t take your farm product. They don\u2019t take your medical machines. We do a big business, they sell us, we don\u2019t sell them, because they put restrictions. We have better equipment than them, but they make it so that our equipment doesn\u2019t qualify. You know, it\u2019s called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers. It\u2019s brutal.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: While the European Union does have non-tariff barriers that make it costly or difficult for US businesses to export products there \u2013 you can read here, for example, about some of the requirements the EU imposes on pork products \u2013 it is a major exaggeration to say EU countries simply \u201cdon\u2019t take\u201d US farm products, cars or medical devices.   As for farm products, the Office of the US Trade Representative says on its website: \u201cU.S. domestic exports of agricultural products to the EU totaled $13.5 billion in 2018. The EU countries together would rank 3rd as an Ag Export Market for the United States.\u201d The same website says the US exported $27.7 billion worth of optical and medical instruments to the EU in 2018.   According to a European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association report earlier this year, \u201cToday, the US is the fourth biggest exporter of cars to the European Union: 19% of the total value of US car exports heads for the EU, representing 12% of EU car imports by value.\u201d The EU\u2019s Eurostat statistical office says that car imports from the US grew from 4 billion euros in 2002 to a peak of 7 billion euros in 2016, then fell to 6 billion euros in 2018.   Henry Ford and the assembly line   \u201cThis is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: It is a popular belief that Ford invented the assembly line, but it is not correct. While Ford was the first to use a moving assembly line for the production of an automobile, Ransom Eli Olds was the first to use an auto assembly line of any kind; he used one to build his Oldsmobile Curved Dash cars at the beginning of the 1900s. (Olds\u2019 production also happened in Michigan.)   Olds\u2019 pioneering version of the assembly line was \u201cnot a moving conveyor, as Henry Ford would install a decade later, but a parade of partially-completed cars swiveling from one work station to another on dollies,\u201d the National Museum of American History explains.   A Ben Domenech quote   \u201c\u2018This is political malpractice. This is a horrible judgement call on the part of the Speaker. You put your members in Trump friendly districts in a very difficult spot. It\u2019s only going to extend it out further. This looks like the joke that it actually is.\u2019 Ben Domenech.\u201d \u2013 December 19 tweet   Facts First: Trump omitted a significant part of this quote \u2013 in which Domenech said on Fox News that he was referring specifically to Democrats in Trump-friendly districts \u201cwho voted for the impeachment.\u201d Trump\u2019s omission erased the fact that members in Trump-friendly districts voted against him.   We give Trump significant latitude to make errors when quoting people on television, but we call it a false claim when he alters the meaning of the quote with major changes or omissions.   An Andy McCarthy quote   \u201c\u2018In the end here, nothing happened. We don\u2019t approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a President should be removed from office. I believe that a President can\u2019t be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the Senate won\u2019t convict and remove the President - Then the House should not be Impeaching the President in the first place. If this is the new standard, every President from here on out is impeachable.\u2019 Andy McCarthy @FoxNews So well stated. Thank you!\u201d \u2013 December 18 tweet   Facts First: Trump omitted a significant part of this quote on Fox News, too.   In between the second-to-last sentence in Trump\u2019s rendition of the quote (\u201cthe House should not be Impeaching the President in the first place\u201d) and the last sentence in Trump\u2019s rendition (\u201cIf this is the new standard, every President from here on out is impeachable\u201d), McCarthy said: \u201cTo go back to Brett Baier\u2019s point earlier about the historic nature of today, yes, President Trump will in the history books from after today, from here on out, be remembered as one of the few presidents in history who are impeached. But I think history also has to be looked at in terms of what does this mean for the history of the United States. I don\u2019t think the President for long is going to be one of the handful of Presidents who is impeached, because\u2026\u201d   In other words, Trump omitted the fact that a friendly pundit said he would go down in history for being impeached.   A Ken Starr quote   \u201c\u2018The evidence has to be overwhelming, and it is not. It\u2019s not even close.\u2019 Ken Starr, Former Independent Counsel.\u201d \u2013 December 18 tweet   Facts First: Trump exaggerated Starr\u2019s comments. While Starr said on Fox News that it is \u201cjust not the case\u201d that the evidence against Trump is \u201coverwhelming,\u201d Starr did not say \u201cit\u2019s not even close.\u201d   Here\u2019s what Starr actually said: \u201cThe evidence, whether it\u2019s circumstantial or direct \u2013 and I think it\u2019s virtually entirely circumstantial \u2013 has to be overwhelming; not just beyond a reasonable doubt, overwhelming to the American people who aren\u2019t sitting in a courtroom and listening to every witness testify and drawing inferences and so forth. When you read the abuse of power article in the Nixon impeachment, a fair-minded person looks at that, reads it, hears it and says he had got to go. That\u2019s just not the case here.\u201d   A Doug Collins quote   \u201c\u2018They just wanted to get at the President. They had no intention of having a proper investigation. They couldn\u2019t find any crimes so they did a vague abuse of power and abuse of Congress, which every administration from the beginning has done.\u2019 @RepDougCollins @foxandfriends\u201d \u2013 December 18 tweet   Facts First: As the Washington Post and New York Times both noted, Trump misquoted Collins \u2013 adding in significant words that Collins did not utter.   Collins didn\u2019t say that \u201cevery administration from the beginning\u201d had committed \u201cabuse of power and abuse of Congress.\u201d He said: \u201cSo they said, \u2018At the end of the day, we can\u2019t form any crimes. We\u2019re going to do a vague abuse of power. And while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s just throw in abuse of \u2013 obstruction of Congress, because we didn\u2019t get our way.\u2019\u201d   Dishwashers   Trump compared modern dishwashers unfavorably to older dishwashers, saying he was proposing to change federal regulations. He said that, in the past, \u201cyou press it, boom,\u201d and the dishwasher cycle would run and be finished in five minutes; \u201cnow, you press it 12 times. Women tell me.\u201d He added, \u201cBy the way, by the time they press it 10 times, you spend more on water and electric. Don\u2019t forget. The whole thing is worse because you\u2019re spending all that money on electric.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims were comprehensively inaccurate. Energy-efficient modern dishwashers do not require people to press buttons 10 times or 12 times to start them. More importantly, those modern dishwashers use less water and electricity than older dishwashers, not more.   The federal government\u2019s website for the Energy Star energy efficiency program notes that Energy Star-certified dishwashers cut people\u2019s electricity bills and save water: \u201cA new ENERGY STAR certified dishwasher will save, on average, 3,870 gallons of water over its lifetime.\u201d Consumer Reports wrote in October: \u201cToday\u2019s dishwashers use about half the water and energy that dishwashers used 20 years ago. Thanks to tougher federal efficiency standards, water usage is down to about 4 to 6 gallons per load \u2013 and less water means less energy required to heat the water.\u201d   It is possible that Trump was confused. Some conservative and industry groups have made a push to get the government to roll back efficiency standards for dishwashers. They argue that modern dishwashers take too long to finish. Trump might have thought that the longer run times mean more water and electricity use, but that is not true.   The disposal of fluorescent light bulbs in Battle Creek, Michigan   \u201cWhen a light bulb is out, you\u2019ve got to bring it to a dump. So let\u2019s say over here in Battle Creek, where\u2019s your nearest dump?\u201d [Trump appears to hear a response from a member of the crowd.] \u201cOK, that\u2019s what, a couple of hundred miles away. So every time you lose, drive a couple of hundred miles.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: It is not true that people in Battle Creek, Michigan need to drive \u201ca couple of hundred miles\u201d to dispose of fluorescent light bulbs. A spokesperson for the city of Battle Creek, Jessica VanderKolk, said there are two collection events per year in Battle Creek itself where people can turn in such bulbs, plus two more collection events per year in the county seat about 11 miles away.   In addition, major store chains, such as Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, allow people to drop off fluorescent bulbs there for free recycling. (We confirmed with the Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s stores in the Battle Creek area that people can do so at those locations.)   An environmental \u201cfine\u201d to San Francisco or Los Angeles   Alleging environmental violations related to San Francisco\u2019s population of homeless people and people who inject drugs, Trump said, \u201cAnd we fined San Francisco \u2013 and Los Angeles and San Francisco. But we\u2019ve just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they\u2019re doing.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: There is no evidence that either San Francisco or Los Angeles has been fined. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency sent San Francisco a \u201cnotice of violation\u201d in October, but that notice merely mentioned the potential for fines in the future. Will Reisman, spokesperson for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, the entity to which the EPA notice was sent, told CNN, \u201cWe have not received any fines from the EPA.\u201d The office of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Los Angeles had not been fined either.   The EPA would not respond directly when asked if Trump\u2019s claim was correct. A spokesman told CNN to ask the White House, saying in an email: \u201c\u2026EPA has issued [a notice of violation] to San Francisco for failing to protect water quality. For details on the Presidents remarks, please reach out to the WH. EPA does not discuss ongoing enforcement actions.\u201d The White House declined to comment.   Penalties for killing bald eagles   Complaining that \u201cwindmills\u201d (his word for wind turbines) kill birds in California, Trump said that, by contrast, \u201cIf you shoot a bald eagle, they want to put you in jail for 10 years.\u201d \u2013 December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit   Facts First: Penalties for shooting a bald eagle are much shorter than 10 years. It wasn\u2019t clear whether Trump was talking about federal law or California law, but he was wrong either way.   The relevant federal laws do not include penalties nearly that long for killing a bald eagle, the National Audubon Society, a nonprofit that works to protect birds, told the Toronto Star in May, when Trump made a \u201cfive years\u201d version of this claim; the penalties are up to two years under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, if someone knowingly shoots a bald eagle with intent to sell or barter it, and up to two years under the Bald and Gold Eagle Protection Act, the National Audubon Society noted. (As the federal government\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service notes on its website, the maximum two-year penalty under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act is for a second conviction; a first conviction has a maximum penalty of one year.)   Patrick Foy, a captain in the law enforcement division for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, sent CNN the relevant section from the state\u2019s Fish and Game Code, which sets out the maximum state penalty for killing a bald eagle at a fine of $5,000, imprisonment in a county jail for a year or less, or both.   Bird deaths   \u201cA windmill will kill many bald eagles. It\u2019s true. And you know what? After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off. That\u2019s true, by the way. \u201d \u2013 December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit   Facts First: While wind turbine operators are exempted from penalties only for a certain number of eagle deaths the federal government agrees to authorize, they are not forced to shut down if they exceed that number.   Wind turbine operators, like other entities whose activities accidentally kill birds, can apply for a permit of up to 30 years to kill a specified number of eagles without facing punishment. But companies whose operations have killed an unauthorized number of eagles are not forced to close; they may be compelled by the federal government to pay fines, make changes to their operations or try to find ways to reduce their impact on birds.   \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily true that somebody\u2019s going to walk in the door and shut it down,\u201d Joel Merriman, director of the Bird-Smart Wind Energy Campaign at the American Bird Conservancy, told CNN.   For example, in 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service touted four civil settlements over the previous 18 months that resulted in commitments from wind companies to pay $55,000 in penalties and to spend a minimum of $1.86 million over three years \u201con research and development of avian detection and deterrent technologies.\u201d Duke Energy agreed in a 2013 plea agreement with the Justice Department to pay $1 million in fines to conservation groups and to come up with a plan to avoid bird deaths in the future.   Trump might perhaps have been thinking of the well-known saga of the company Altamont Winds, which announced in 2015 that it would shut down its turbines in California\u2019s Altamont Pass. The turbines had been the subject of numerous complaints from bird advocates, but the shutdown was the company\u2019s own decision.   Sen. Mazie Hirono and the Green New Deal   \u201cHow about the senator from Hawaii? Nasty\u2026She wants the Green New Deal, and then they informed her that that does not include airplanes. And you\u2019re the senator from Hawaii. So they said, \u2018What are you going to do?\u2019 And then they talked about building a train to Hawaii, can you believe it? No, no, she wants it, even though you can\u2019t \u2013 you\u2019ll never get to Hawaii again. Say goodbye to Hawaii. No, it\u2019s crazy, isn\u2019t it, though?\u201d \u2013 December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit   Facts First: It is not true that Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono decided to support the Green New Deal and then was informed afterward that the deal \u201cdoes not include airplanes,\u201d nor that she later started talking about building a train to Hawaii. Trump was mischaracterizing an exchange Hirono had with a reporter in February.   Here is what actually happened. When told by a reporter that the Green New Deal would try to eliminate air travel and move to high-speed rail across the country, Hirono said that would be \u201cpretty hard for Hawaii,\u201d then laughed. She did not explain her laughter at that moment, but as she explained later, the Green New Deal resolution Hirono had endorsed does not actually call for the elimination of air travel.   Rather, the resolution calls for \u201coverhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail.\u201d That is not a call to completely eliminate air travel.   So where did the reporter get his premise? Possibly from a controversial \u201cFAQ\u201d page posted by a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which had urged the government to \u201cbuild out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.\u201d But other Democrats did not endorse the FAQ, just the official resolution, and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office quickly deleted it.   When Trump made a similar claim about Hirono, the Green New Deal and air travel in February, Hirono told HawaiiNewsNow: \u201cAs usual, climate change denier Donald Trump makes things up and doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. While the Green New Deal is an ambitious plan to combat climate change, it does not call for the elimination of air travel. I will continue to fight against this president\u2019s lies.\u201d   Democrats and factories   \u201cAnd what they want to do is they want to get rid of all petroleum product. That means you basically won\u2019t have any factories in the United States.\u201d \u2013 December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit   Facts First: It is true that some prominent Democratic candidates want the US to end the use of fossil fuels   over time, but achieving an end to American petroleum use would not mean there would be no American factories.   Joshua Busby, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Texas who studies energy and environmental policy, noted that manufacturers who simply require electricity to power their factories could get that electricity from renewable sources. \u201cSolar and wind are cost competitive across much of the United States with natural gas, and the lowest cost option in a number of locations,\u201d Busby said. And he noted that most US petroleum use is in transportation \u2013 motor gasoline alone made up 46% of US petroleum use in 2018, according to the federal government \u2013 not in industrial production; the use of vehicles that run without using petroleum could be greatly expanded. Some heavy industries \u201cwill be difficult sectors to fully decarbonize and move to 100% renewables, but nobody is proposing to do that overnight,\u201d Busby said.   Judicial appointments   \u201c187 new Federal Judges have been confirmed under the Trump Administration, including two great new United States Supreme Court Justices. We are shattering every record!\u201d \u2013 December 24 tweet   Facts First: Trump has set at least one important record on judicial appointments \u2013 he has appointed more appeals court judges than any other president at this point in a term \u2013 but not \u201cevery record.\u201d Notably, the statistic he cited in this tweet, 187 total judges confirmed, is not a record, according to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments.   President Jimmy Carter had appointed 197 people to federal courts by December 20 of his third year in office, Wheeler said. If you go by the percentage of the judiciary appointed, both Carter (29%) and President Richard Nixon (31%) had Trump (21%) beat, according to data Wheeler provided to CNN.   Trump had appointed 50 people to the federal appeals courts as of December 20, according to Wheeler\u2019s data and recent news reports. Carter had appointed 48 by the same point of his own presidency.   Merry Christmas   \u201cAnd did you notice that everybody is saying Merry Christmas again? Did you notice? Saying Merry Christmas.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   \u201cAnd let me begin by wishing you a beautiful \u2013 look, do you remember this? Do you remember they were trying to take \u2018Christmas\u2019 out of Christmas? Do you remember? They didn\u2019t want to let you say \u2018Merry Christmas.\u2019 You would go around, you\u2019d see department stores that have everything \u2013 red, snow, beautiful ribbons, bows. Everything was there, but they wouldn\u2019t say \u2018Merry Christmas.\u2019 They\u2019re all saying \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 again. You remember? I went through that, during the campaign: \u2018They going to say Merry Christmas again.\u2019 And they are.\u201d \u2013 December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit   Facts First: There is no evidence that people are now saying \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d any more frequently than they did under previous presidents, nor that all stores that declined to use the phrase before Trump\u2019s presidency have changed their policies.   It\u2019s hard to measure this stuff, but one metric is the socially conservative American Family Association\u2019s annual list of retailers that it considers \u201cnaughty\u201d or \u201cnice\u201d when it comes to its willingness to use the word \u201cChristmas\u201d in promotional materials. Not one of the 17 \u201cnaughty\u201d companies the AFA listed in a press release in December 2015, the year Trump launched his presidential campaign, had been promoted to \u201cnice\u201d on the 2019 list, though two had moved from \u201cnaughty\u201d to \u201cmarginal.\u201d   Military airplanes   \u201cSo we spent a lot of money on brand-new airplanes, as you know. We were \u2013 three years ago, you didn\u2019t have brand-new airplanes. You were not doing well. And now you have all brand new.\u201d \u2013 December 24 teleconference with members of the military   Facts First: This was a major exaggeration. While Trump\u2019s administration has invested in new military planes, it is not even close to true that the planes currently in use are \u201call brand new.\u201d   In December 2018, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the average Air Force plane in 2017 was 28.3 years old: \u201cThey range widely in age from the 75 new aircraft that entered service in 2017 to the 21 60-year-old KC-135 tankers that entered service in 1958. The largest share of the fleet is 26\u201330 years old.\u201d The average age for fighter and attack planes was 26.4 years, for bombers 42.0 years, for tankers 53.7 years.   In addition, \u201cThe military was buying new aircraft all throughout the Obama administration, like the F-35,\u201d said Todd Harrison, director of the Aerospace Security Project and director of Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.   \u201cYou know, Roger Stone was not involved in my campaign in any way \u2013 other than the very, very beginning, before I \u2013 I think, I \u2013 long before I announced \u2013 a little bit.\u201d And: \u201cAnd again, Roger Stone was not a part of it \u2013 the campaign. He was somebody I\u2019ve known over the years, but not a part of the campaign. Very, very, very early on \u2013 long before I \u2013 I think long before I even announced, he was involved in a minor way.\u201d \u2013 December 24 exchange with reporters after teleconference with members of the military   Facts First: Stone was involved in Trump\u2019s campaign after Trump announced his candidacy, not merely before. Trump announced his run in June 2015; Stone either resigned or was fired \u2013 there is a dispute about what happened \u2013 in August 2015, more than a month and a half into the campaign.   Prosecutors at Stone\u2019s trial this year \u2013 which resulted in his conviction on charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing a congressional committee proceeding \u2013 introduced as evidence phone records that suggested Stone and Trump also spoke in 2016, after Stone\u2019s official role with the campaign ended.   \u201c\u2026how about the Ninth Circuit? Do you know that, as of next week \u2013 do you know that we\u2019re going to be even on the Ninth Circuit? This was a disaster. We put a lot of judges on the Ninth Circuit.\u201d \u2013 December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit   Facts First: While Trump has made 10 appointments to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, whose decisions he has previously complained about, it was not true at the time he spoke that the 29-member court was going to be \u201ceven\u201d by \u201cnext week\u201d between judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats (\u201cNext week\u201d has now passed.) The margin at the time was 16 Democratic appointees to 13 Republican appointees, and there were no additional vacancies for Trump to fill.   \u201cAlthough it is true that President Trump has \u2018put a lot of judges on the Ninth Circuit,\u2019 there is no chance that it will be tied by \u2018next week.\u2019 In fact, it probably won\u2019t be tied by next year,\u201d said Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law and an expert on the Ninth Circuit. \u201cTo get a tie (or better), two Democratic appointees would have to retire. All nine of the active judges appointed by President Clinton are eligible to retire, but I doubt that any of them will do so before the November election. Unless Democratic appointees retire or leave the bench (or Congress adds new judgeships), there can\u2019t be a Republican majority or even a tie.\u201d   \u201c\u20263 years ago they were forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone in the first debate against Crooked Hillary.\u201d \u2013 December 16 tweet   Facts First: The Commission on Presidential Debates did not publicly apologize for Trump\u2019s microphone issue at the first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton three years ago. (It also did not acknowledge any deliberate manipulation of Trump\u2019s microphone.) It issued a one-line statement that said: \u201cRegarding the first debate, there were issues regarding Donald Trump\u2019s audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall.\u201d   Here are the claims Trump made over these two weeks that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:   The US share of NATO   Trump said the United States used to pay for \u201c100% of NATO.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: According to the most recent official NATO figures, released in November 2019, US military spending represented between about 71% and about 73% of NATO members\u2019 total military spending in 2014, 2015 and 2016. That is a hefty percentage, but \u201c100%\u201d is an exaggeration. (The US share of NATO military expenditures has declined to about 69% per year under Trump.)   Previous presidents and NATO   Trump said previous presidents had not demanded military spending increases from NATO members: \u201cPresident Obama would go down to make a speech. \u2018I\u2019d like to thank everybody for being here, thanks a lot, great job, sayonara, bye.\u2019 Bush, they all did. Nobody ever asked for money.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: It\u2019s not true that Obama and Bush never asked NATO members to increase their military spending. Obama and Bush both did so, though their public language was less confrontational than Trump\u2019s has been.   Obama repeatedly urged NATO allies to spend more. \u201cIf we\u2019ve got a collective defense, it means that everybody\u2019s got to chip in, and I\u2019ve had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in NATO,\u201d Obama said in 2014. \u201cThe situation in Ukraine reminds us that our freedom isn\u2019t free and we\u2019ve got to be willing to pay for the assets, the personnel, the training that\u2019s required to make sure that we have a credible NATO force and an effective deterrent force.\u201d   At Bush\u2019s final NATO summit, in 2008, Bush called on NATO allies to \u201cincrease their defense investments to support both NATO and EU operations.\u201d   The Coast Guard and Hurricane Harvey   \u201cYou know, the Coast Guard, with the work they\u2019ve done during hurricane season, two years ago, in Texas \u2013 in particular, Texas \u2013 because they saved 16,000 lives. Nobody understands what that means \u2013 16,000. Even me \u2013 I heard that number, and I said, \u2018Can that be possible? Sixteen thousand.\u2019 They served 16,000 lives \u2013 and saved.\u201d \u2013 December 24 teleconference with members of the military   Facts First: The Coast Guard says the correct number is 11,022 people rescued. (This was not a one-time slip; Trump has regularly said \u201c16,000.\u201d)   Military pay increases   \u201cBut this Christmas, I hope that every member of our military will feel the overwhelming love and gratitude of our nation for your faithful service. Starting January 1st, you\u2019ll be getting your largest pay raise in more than a decade.\u201d And: \u201c\u2026it will be largest in over a decade, and you very much earned it. \u2013 December 24 teleconference with members of the military   Facts First: Trump was exaggerating slightly when he said the troops will get their largest increase in \u201cmore than\u201d and \u201cover\u201d a decade. Both the 2019 pay increase of 2.6% and the planned 2020 increase of 3.1% are the largest since 2010, so nine years and 10 years ago respectively.   (We know this is a minor stretch, but Trump has relentlessly embellished accurate numbers by adding words like \u201cover\u201d and \u201cmore than,\u201d so it\u2019s a pattern of little dishonesty rather than a one-time error.)   NATO spending increases   \u201cOver the last period of just two years. I raised \u2013 not from us, nothing from us \u2013 $130 billion, but that\u2019s nothing. And over a short period of time, they will be paying $530 billion more, all of those countries.\u201d And: \u201cThey have to pay \u2013 $530 billion and the fake news doesn\u2019t want to even talk about it. They don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u2019\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Trump\u2019s math was wrong: the $130 billion current increase in military spending by non-US NATO members (over 2016 levels) cannot be added to the $400 billion increase expected by 2024; the $400 billion figure includes the $130 billion.   NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg explained during a meeting with Trump on December 3 that non-US NATO members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. By 2024, Stoltenberg said, \u201cthis number will increase to $400 billion.\u201d   The history of NATO spending   Trump said of military spending by NATO members before he took office: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, if you look, it\u2019s like 15 years, just down.\u201d He drew a downward-sloping line in the air with his hand. \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump\u2019s presidency. According to the latest NATO figures, released in November, spending increased by 1.7% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016.   Veterans Choice   Trump said three times that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice program passed. He said once that people had been trying to do so for \u201c44 years,\u201d twice that people had been trying for almost \u201c50 years.\u201d   Facts First: The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.   Military spending   Trump said twice that the US military has spent $2.5 trillion during his presidency.   Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama\u2019s tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.   Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the \u201c$2.5 trillion\u201d figure \u2013 but the 2020 fiscal year just started on October 1, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.   Chinese tariffs   \u201cAs you know, we\u2019re now getting along very well with China and trade. In fact, they just took tariffs off more than 800 products, where they were charging us tariffs. And now those tariffs are gone.\u201d \u2013 December 24 teleconference with members of the military   Facts First: \u201cGone\u201d was an exaggeration. China announced the day prior that it will lower, not eliminate, tariffs on more than 850 US products starting on January 1.   Manufacturing jobs   \u201cWell, we\u2019ve got 600,000 manufacturing jobs and you\u2019re going to see a big, big increase.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The economy added 497,000 manufacturing jobs between January 2017, when Trump took office, and November 2019, official data shows. The number is 524,000 jobs added if you go back to November 2016, the month of Trump\u2019s election, as Trump often likes to do.   Hillary Clinton and the trade agreement with South Korea   \u201c\u2026the people that made these trade deals, it\u2019s like, where did they come? Like the one in Korea, that was a Hillary Clinton special. She said this will produce 250,000 new jobs, and I said, well, what happened? He said, well, she was right except it was for South Korea, not for us. So it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: There is no record of Hillary Clinton projecting an increase of 250,000 jobs because of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). President Barack Obama said the deal would \u201csupport at least 70,000 American jobs.\u201d   Obama said in 2009 that increasing the US share of trade with Asia from 9% to 10% \u201ccould mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs,\u201d but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with South Korea. Republican Rep. Kevin Brady later used an estimate of \u201cabout 250,000 new jobs\u201d from trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama combined, not just the one with South Korea.   Pelosi and USMCA   \u201cThe great USMCA Trade Deal (Mexico & Canada) has been sitting on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s desk for 8 months, she doesn\u2019t even know what it says, & today, after passing by a wide margin in the House, Pelosi tried to take credit for it\u2026\u201d \u2013 December 19 tweet   Facts First: The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement was not been sitting on Pelosi\u2019s desk for \u201c8 months\u201d before she agreed in December to have the Democrat-controlled House to pass it. Though the Trump administration had pushed Pelosi to persuade the House to quickly pass the agreement, it had not sent her any implementing legislation.   In fact, the President\u2019s trade team chose to negotiate with her to address the concerns of Democrats rather than immediately sending her a bill to which some of her party\u2019s caucus might have had significant objections.   Household income gains   \u201cTotal income gains for median households will reach $10,000 a family. I\u2019ll give you a couple of quick numbers. So under President Bush, for eight years, you saved $450, meaning you took in $450. OK, fine. Under President Obama, you took in $975. Under President Trump, including the energy savings and the regulation savings and the tax cuts savings, it\u2019s more than $10,000 in less than three years. Pretty good, right? So for two eight years, you had a $400, $450 and a $975. That\u2019s eight years, $450. In less than three years, you had more than $10,000. That goes right into your pockets.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: We can\u2019t fact check Trump\u2019s prediction that household income gains under him \u201cwill\u201d reach $10,000 a family, but his claim that the number has already hit $10,000 in less than three years is inaccurate. A firm called Sentier Research has found pre-tax income gains of more than $5,00 between January 2017 and October 2019, but any gains from cuts to regulations or in reductions in energy prices would be included in this amount, not added on top of it. Also, it is entirely unclear what Trump is referring to when he talks about \u201cenergy savings\u201d; household energy costs have increased since Trump took office, as have gasoline costs. (Gasoline costs are lower than they were for most of Obama\u2019s presidency, but higher than they were in 2016.)   You can read a longer fact check here.   Japanese automakers and Michigan   \u201cBut Michigan\u2019s had the best year it\u2019s ever had. Best year it\u2019s ever had. And that\u2019s because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they\u2019re coming in from Japan and they\u2019re coming in from a lot of other places.\u201d  \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Japanese automakers have announced just two new US plants during Trump\u2019s presidency, and neither is to be built in Michigan.   Toyota and Mazda announced a joint venture in 2018 to build a plant in Alabama. Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research, said in November there had been only one other Japanese announcement of a new auto plant under Trump: Hino Motors\u2019 2017 decision to move its West Virginia truck assembly operations to a bigger West Virginia location.   Prescription drug prices   \u201cOur drug price is down for the first time in 51 years, drug prices came down\u2026\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs showed a 0.6% decline between December 2017 and December 2018, which was the first calendar-year decline since 1972 \u2013 the first decline in 46 years, not the first one in \u201cmore than 50 years.\u201d (As the Washington Post pointed out in its own fact check, some experts say the Consumer Price Index is a flawed measure of trends in drug prices, since it doesn\u2019t include rebates that drug companies pay to insurers. The IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, which studies drug prices, found that \u201cnet drug prices in the United States increased at an estimated 1.5% in 2018.   Obama and manufacturing   \u201cRemember the statement by President Obama, \u2018You\u2019d have to wave a magic wand.\u2019 Remember, the magic wand, because manufacturing. And I said, you know, that sounds strange. What do you do if you don\u2019t have manufacturing? How do you make things, right? \u2018Manufacturing jobs won\u2019t happen.\u2019\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Trump\u2019s \u201cmagic wand\u201d comment was a reference to a remark President Barack Obama made at a PBS town hall in 2016 \u2013 but he was inaccurately describing what Obama said. Obama scoffed at Trump\u2019s promises to bring back what Obama called \u201cjobs of the past\u201d without providing specifics on how he would do so. Contrary to Trump\u2019s claims, though, Obama didn\u2019t say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; Obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, \u201cWe actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we\u2019ve had in most of our history.\u201d   November jobs estimates   Trump boasted of the 266,000 jobs added in November, then said, \u201cAnd you know they said \u2013 if you\u2019re a business watcher, which I am. I love watching business, but they said they were guessing: could be 70,000, could be 80,000, maybe 90, maybe 110, somebody said.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: While the number of jobs added by the US economy in November, 266,000, did exceed analysts\u2019 expectations, those expectations were much higher than Trump claimed. The median estimate from economists surveyed by Reuters was 180,000 jobs added \u2013 and the lowest of the economists\u2019 estimates was 120,000 jobs added.   Trump did not specify who he was talking about when he repeatedly referred to an unnamed \u201cthey\u201d and \u201csomebody\u201d; it is certainly plausible that somebody somewhere thought that a mere 70,000, 80,000 or 90,000 jobs would be added. (His last number, 110,000, wasn\u2019t too far off from reality.) But Trump created the impression that he was talking about the expectations of economic experts.   Unemployment for women   Trump said twice that the unemployment rate for women was the best or lowest in \u201c71 years.\u201d   Facts First: It had been 66 years, not 71 years, since the women\u2019s unemployment rate has been as low as it was in November, 3.5%. (That\u2019s if you ignore the 3.4% in September and April.)   Energy production   Trump said three times that he had \u201cended the war on American energy,\u201d and \u201cthe United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas.\u201d On a third occasion, he touted \u201cbecoming the world\u2019s top energy producer\u201d as one of his accomplishments in office.   Facts First: The US has not just \u201cnow\u201d become the world\u2019s top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012, according to the US government\u2019s Energy Information Administration \u2013 under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a \u201cwar\u201d on the industry.   The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump\u2019s tenure. \u201cThe United States has been the world\u2019s top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world\u2019s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia\u2019s,\u201d the Energy Information Administration says.   Revenue from tariffs on China   \u201cAnd you know, China\u2019s paying us billions and billions of dollars a year. They never gave us 10 cents.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Americans make the actual tariff payments, and a bevy of economic studies, including a report in late November from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, have found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, Aside from the question of who is paying, it\u2019s not true that the Treasury has never received \u201c10 cents\u201d from tariffs on China. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; FactCheck.org reported that the US generated an \u201caverage of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.\u201d   Trump\u2019s claim also ignores China\u2019s hundreds of billions of dollars in purchases of US goods \u2013 more than $300 billion during Trump\u2019s presidency alone.   \u201cDirty cops\u201d at the FBI   Trump referred four times to former FBI director James Comey as a \u201cdirty cop.\u201d   Facts First: We give Trump wide latitude to express opinions about public figures, but the December report from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz presented no evidence that Comey was corrupt in any way. Horowitz found significant errors in FBI work connected to the Russia investigation, and rejected Comey\u2019s claim of vindication, but he did not make any finding accusing Comey of deliberate malfeasance.   The cost of the Mueller investigation   \u201cAfter three years of unfair and unwarranted investigations, 45 million dollars spent\u2026\u201d \u2013 December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi   \u201c\u2026but think of this, $45 million they spent\u2026\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: The Mueller investigation Trump keeps saying cost \u201c$45 million\u201d actually cost $32 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department, and the government is expected to recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, most from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.   What Biden said \u201clooked bad\u201d   \u201cBiden openly stated: \u2018I said, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars\u201d\u2026 I looked at them and said: \u201cI\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u201d Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.\u2019\u201d Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it \u2018looked bad.\u2019\u201d \u2013 December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi   Facts First: Trump was not entirely clear on what he meant by \u201cit,\u201d but he left the impression that Biden had recently told NPR that his effort to oust Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, or the 2018 video of him telling the story of his effort to oust Shokin, \u201clooked bad.\u201d In fact, Biden\u2019s \u201clooked bad\u201d comment was about something different: Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board. Specifically, Biden said \u201cthe appearance\u201d of Hunter Biden\u2019s presence on the board \u201clooked bad and it gave folks like Rudy Giuliani an excuse to come up with a Trumpian kind of defense.\u201d   What Zelensky said   \u201cPresident Zelensky has repeatedly declared that I did nothing wrong, and that there was No Pressure. He further emphasized that it was a \u2018good phone call,\u2019 that \u2018I don\u2019t feel pressure,\u2019 and explicitly stressed that \u2018nobody pushed me.\u2019\u201d \u2013 December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi   Facts First: Zelensky did say there had been \u201cno pressure\u201d from Trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say Trump did nothing wrong.   In an interview published by Time magazine in early December, Zelensky did say, \u201cLook, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That\u2019s not my thing.\u201d But Zelensky continued: \u201cI don\u2019t want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We\u2019re at war. If you\u2019re our strategic partner, then you can\u2019t go blocking anything for us. I think that\u2019s just about fairness. It\u2019s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.\u201d   The accuracy of the whistleblower   Trump criticized \u201cthe so-called whistleblower who started this entire hoax with a false report of the phone call that bears no relationship to the actual phone call that was made.\u201d \u2013 December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi   Facts First: The whistleblower\u2019s account of Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been proven highly accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower\u2019s three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. You can read a full fact check here.   The whistleblowers having \u201cdisappeared\u201d   \u201cOnce I presented the transcribed call, which surprised and shocked the fraudsters (they never thought that such evidence would be presented), the so-called whistleblower, and the second whistleblower, disappeared because they got caught, their report was a fraud, and they were no longer going to be made available to us.\u201d \u2013 December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi   Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers said they had firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow \u201cgone,\u201d let alone that they are \u201cgone\u201d because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.   \u201cThe whistleblowers have not vanished,\u201d Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter in October, when Trump made another version of this claim.   The first whistleblower\u2019s lawyers, Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, wrote in the Washington Post in October: \u201cBecause our client has no additional information about the president\u2019s call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow.\u201d   The existence of the second whistleblower \u2013 who never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint \u2013 was revealed after Trump released the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky, not before.   The Salem Witch Trials   \u201cMore due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials.\u201d \u2013 December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi   Facts First: Trump might have meant this as a non-literal figure of speech, but as a factual matter, the claim is absurd. (Salem\u2019s current mayor told Trump to \u201clearn some history.\u201d) Nineteen innocent people were hanged after they were accused of witchcraft in the trials of the late 1600s. The courts accepted \u201cspectral evidence\u201d from dreams. Some of the accused were tortured into confessions.   The rough transcript   \u201cFortunately, there was a transcript of the conversation taken, and you know from the transcript (which was immediately made available) that the paragraph in question was perfect.\u201d \u2013 December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi   Facts First: The call occurred in July. Trump released the rough transcript in September, after the public learned of the existence of the whistleblower complaint about the call and after a series of news reports that raised questions about the call. (The Washington Post reported at the time: \u201cTrump\u2019s decision to release the transcript follows nearly a week of speculation around what he specifically asked for during a call that an intelligence official found so problematic he filed an official complaint.\u201d)   Mexican soldiers and the border   \u201cAnd, as you know, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border right now protecting our border.\u201d \u2013 December 17 remarks at meeting with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales   Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN reported on November 2: \u201cNearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico\u2019s northern border, where they\u2019ve set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country\u2019s security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.\u201d   Acting US Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in September that 10,000 of approximately 25,000 troops were on Mexico\u2019s southern border.   Deportations to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador   \u201cOne of the big things that\u2019s happened with Guatemala \u2013 and Honduras, El Salvador, and some others \u2013 is that, in past administrations, they and others would not take people back. So if we had very dangerous people in our country and they came from Guatemala, or another country that we now have agreements with \u2013 we never had agreements with anybody \u2013 they just wouldn\u2019t take them back. But now they have to take them back, and they take them back with open arms.\u201d \u2013 December 17 remarks at meeting with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales   \u201cAnd we have agreements now with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador \u2013 you know they didn\u2019t use to take them back. If we had a murderer and we said \u2018get them the hell out, you know, we don\u2019t really want them in our prisons and take care of them for 50, 60 years. We want to bring them back,\u2019 they wouldn\u2019t take them. The planes used to go around and around \u2013 \u2018Don\u2019t land, don\u2019t land.\u2019 With us, they land. We worked at deals with every one of them. We stop giving them all the aid. You know we\u2019re giving them all this money and then they said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to let you land, we\u2019re not going to let you take them back.\u2019\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all three of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport. In 2016, just prior to Trump\u2019s presidency, none of the three countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered \u201crecalcitrant\u201d (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.   You can read a longer fact check in this article.   Democrats and borders, part 1   Trump said twice that Democrats support a policy of \u201copen borders.\u201d On a third occasion, he made this accusation specifically about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.   Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.   While Pelosi wants a more liberal immigration policy than Trump does, she has repeatedly endorsed funding for border security measures aside from the President\u2019s proposed wall.   Democrats and borders, part 2   \u201cThe Democrat Party is trying to shred our Constitution, tear down our history, erase the nation\u2019s borders. They don\u2019t want to have any borders.\u201d \u2013 December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit   Facts First: This claim is baseless. The Democratic Party is not trying to eliminate borders.   The Electoral College result in 2016   \u201cYour chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306-227), and you and your party have never recovered from this defeat.\u201d \u2013 December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi   Facts First: Leaving aside Trump\u2019s characterization of the result as a \u201clandslide,\u201d he got the numbers wrong \u2013 again. If he was going by the number of electoral votes each candidate earned in the voting, the result was 306 for him to 232 for Clinton. If he was going by the final result, after some \u201cfaithless electors\u201d defected from both him and Clinton, the result was 304 for him to 227 for Clinton. This was not a one-time slip; Trump is habitually inaccurate about this.   Right to Try   Trump said that people have been trying to get a national Right to Try law passed for 49 years: \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to do it for 49 years.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: There had not been a 49-year push to get such a law passed before Trump signed it in May 2018. (The law aims to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access medications that have not been granted final approval.) Similar laws have been passed at the state level only since 2014, after the Goldwater Institute, a libertarian think tank, began pushing for them.   \u201cI have no idea what \u2018they\u2019ve been trying to get\u2019 for 44 years,\u201d Alison Bateman-House, assistant professor of medical ethics at New York University\u2019s Langone Health, said in response to a previous version of Trump\u2019s claim. \u201cThe Right to Try law was a creation of the Goldwater Institute, and it first became state law in 2014 (in Colorado), relatively soon after it was first conceived of.   Michigan\u2019s \u201cMan of the Year\u201d   Trump said twice that he was named \u201cMan of the Year\u201d in Michigan about 10 years ago.   Facts First: CNN and other news outlets have found no evidence Trump was ever named Michigan\u2019s man of the year. You can read our full fact check on this claim here.   Trump\u2019s crowds   On separate occasions, Trump said that \u201cI\u2019ve never had an empty seat\u201d and that \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had an empty seat from the time I came down the escalator.\u201d   Facts First: There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including an October rally Minneapolis, a July rally in Greenville, North Carolina, an October 2018 rally in Houston and an April 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.   Newspapers\u2019 election polls   \u201cThe problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write. They write fake polls. It\u2019s true. They write fake polls. You call them suppression polls. You read them and you get depressed because it looks like you\u2019re doing badly. They do that. I think it\u2019s almost worse than what they write, and you can\u2019t get much worse than what they write.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   Facts First: There is simply no evidence that newspaper pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.   A CNN camera   Trump praised Fox News host Laura Ingraham, then said, \u201cYou know, now the CNN \u2013 the CNN cameras \u2013 all the cameras just turned off. That\u2019s okay. They don\u2019t want to promote Laura.\u201d \u2013 December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit   Facts First: CNN did not turn off its camera as Trump promoted Ingraham; it was serving as the \u201cpool\u201d camera feeding the speech to various networks. And CNN did not stop broadcasting Trump\u2019s speech; CNN was not even airing the speech live on television. (Also, CNN\u2019s photojournalists at Trump events have the \u201ctally\u201d lights on their cameras set permanently to off, so Trump would have no way of seeing from the stage even if they did ever turn a camera off.) Trump has repeatedly made versions of this false claim.   Obama\u2019s judicial vacancies   Trumps said twice that President Barack Obama left him \u201c142\u201d judicial vacancies.   Facts First: Trump exaggerated. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.   For database:   The history of judicial vacancies   Mocking Obama for supposedly leaving him \u201c142\u201d judicial vacancies \u2013 we explained in the item above that this figure is inaccurate \u2013 Trump said, \u201cI mean, normally, when you leave office, you leave none. You leave none.\u201d \u2013 December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit   Facts First: It\u2019s not true that outgoing presidents usually leave no judicial vacancies to their successors. According to Wheeler, there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office.   So Trump had the most judges to appoint since Clinton, but, clearly, other presidents also had appointing to do.   \u201cRepublicans will strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions.\u201d \u2013 December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan   \u201cWe take care of pre-existing conditions. They\u2019re not going to be able to do that. \u2013 December 19 remarks at meeting with Rep. Jeff Van Drew   Facts First: Democrats already did \u201ctake care of\u201d pre-existing conditions: they created protections for people with such conditions in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the law they passed in 2010 over Republican opposition.   The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Frank Wuco, a former conservative speaker and radio host who is now a senior adviser at the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, also said it would be tough for a \u201csolid, practicing\u201d Muslim to be a good American and made unfounded claims that some Muslims in America were practicing Sharia law to create \u201cMuslim land.\u201d   Wuco\u2019s comments, which span from 2009 to 2016, were unearthed by CNN\u2019s KFile during a review of his media appearances and public writings.   Wuco has a history of peddling conspiracy theories, pushing for extreme American action in warfare and spreading anti-Muslim rhetoric. CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported that Wuco interviewed authors promoting birtherism and pushed other conspiracy theories on prominent Obama administration officials.   Wuco had a career as a radio host and pundit before joining the Trump administration in 2017. During that time, Wuco frequently cited his past experience in the Navy to promote himself as an expert on jihad and military matters, such as when he expressed his personal belief that nuclear weapons should have been used in Afghanistan the day after 9/11.   Wuco was previously a White House adviser at the Department of Homeland Security. His new role at the State Department was first reported by the Washington Post last month. The State Department\u2019s Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance mission statement says it is responsible for \u201cdeterring conflict\u201d and working to build \u201ccooperation among allies and partners in order to control the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction.\u201d   The State Department and Wuco did not respond to requests for comment.   During Wuco\u2019s career as a conservative talk show host from 2011 to 2013, he frequently belittled and mocked Democratic leadership and liberals on his platforms.   At a 2013 event with Tea Party supporters, Wuco gave a speech critical of Obama. After a man from the crowd shouted that Obama was \u201ca plagiarizer,\u201d Wuco responded: \u201cI thought he was a Kenyan!\u201d   Wuco used his platform as a radio host to promote the debunked conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the US and questioned whether Obama sounded \u201csuper ethnic\u201d for a man who knew \u201cnothing about the black American experience.\u201d   On an episode of The Frank Wuco Show in 2011, Wuco called Pelosi \u201cNancy Nazi Pelosi\u201d and mocked her appearance, saying that her \u201cBotox\u201d had worn off. He likened the moment to a \u201cDarth Vader\u201d reveal, alluding to the iconic Star Wars villain removing his helmet.   \u201cSeeing her last night, it made me think \u2013 I\u2019ll have to ask my brother-in-law who\u2019s a plastic surgeon if this is true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you that Botox has got to have an expiration date on it. No, I\u2019m not talking about Botox in the bottle. I am talking about Botox in your face. And apparently from what I saw last night, it\u2019s not a gradual expiration.\u201d   Wuco has publicly and loudly pushed anti-Muslim views in his radio appearances and writings for well over a decade.   Wuco said some Muslim American communities called \u201cfor the application of Sharia law\u201d so the community would become \u201cMuslim land.\u201d Wuco called the city of Karachi, Pakistan, one of the largest Muslim cities in the world, a \u201cpit of filth, poverty, human despair, that is about as good as Pakistani cities get\u201d in a blog post in 2010. He referred to French Muslim women as \u201chijab hysterical.\u201d   \u201cMuslims here in the United States and in many European countries create sort of these enclave communities. They move into an area, they sort of concentrate their presence in a certain area \u2013 and a lot of that is good, old fashioned, just people wanting to be near people that they\u2019re familiar with culturally and religiously and all that stuff,\u201d he said on AM Tampa Bay in 2014.   \u201cAnother piece of it, if you want to go even deeper, is you\u2019ve seen a lot of these densely populated Muslim areas where in some cases they actually start calling for the application of Sharia law in these areas,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you want it to carry it to the furthest extreme where you have an area that has densely populated with Muslims, where they\u2019re able to manage to get Sharia law applied in Islamic theology, that then becomes Muslim land.   In the same appearance, Wuco was asked if it is possible to be a \u201cgood American and a good Muslim.\u201d   He paused before answering, \u201cThat\u2019s a tough one.\u201d Wuco said that in the eyes of theological purists like ISIS, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to be a good anything and a good Muslim because in Islamic theology, you\u2019re everything Islamic \u2013 people, the land, the property is all in the house of Islam. You don\u2019t have a nationality. You\u2019re a Muslim.\u201d   He added, \u201cSo I would say no. If you\u2019re a purist and you\u2019re a real, good, solid, practicing Muslim it becomes very, very tough.\u201d   Wuco also expressed disbelief of any backlash against Muslim Americans after a terrorist incident or suspected terrorist arrests in America.   \u201cThere IS NO BACKLASH. And is that our biggest concern, REALLY??? Backlash??? How about the backlash of fear among YOUR FELLOW AMERICAN CITIZENS, that they are AFRAID TO GO TO THE MALL, the MALL!!! Mall owners are now spending $10,000\u2032s on a public campaign to calm shoppers that they are not going to be the victims of a jihad-inspired mass murder while they do a little early Christmas shopping,\u201d Wuco wrote in a blog post from October 2009.   \u201cWE are a good society! We don\u2019t murder, maim, and harass ethnic groups writ large (a PLEASE, if you hit me with the slavery issue or what befell the American Indians in the 19th Century, I\u2019ll delete your ridiculous post),\u201d he continued.   Wuco frequently spoke and wrote about the military over the years. In an interview with the Dougherty Report radio show in 2016, Wuco contended that war needs to be censored from everyday Americans.   \u201cPeople at home shouldn\u2019t be seeing warfare. Warfare is a very ugly thing. It needs to be done in an extremely ugly and violent way,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that war should be censored.\u201d   \u201cThere are things in war that defy common sense,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere are things in war that defy common decency. It\u2019s war. So, you don\u2019t want to direct all of your energy answering questions on why you did something horrific in wartime when war is entirely horrific. Either it is or it isn\u2019t. There\u2019s no nice way to do warfare.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans \u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network.", "Trump made 50 false claims last week, 13 about the whistleblower | CNN Politics": " President Donald Trump keeps making a systematic effort to convince Americans to reject the actual facts of his dealings with Ukraine.   Trump made 50 false claims last week. Thirteen were related to Democrats\u2019 Ukraine-centric impeachment inquiry. This was the fifth consecutive week that Trump made more false claims about the impeachment inquiry or Ukraine than about any other subject.   Fifty false claims from the President in seven days is not good, per se, but it is an improvement from his recent barrage of dishonesty, which included an October week of 129 false claims.   Fifty false claims is the fourth-lowest total for the 17 weeks we have fact checked at CNN since July 8   Trump made 16 of the 50 false claims at his campaign rally in Mississippi. He made 11 on Twitter.   The most egregious false claims: On the whistleblower   The whistleblower who complained about Trump\u2019s Ukraine-related behavior has been the primary target of his multi-front effort to rewrite the reality of the story.   Just last week, Trump said on three more occasions that the whistleblower\u2019s account of his phone call with the president of Ukraine was \u201csooo wrong\u201d and \u201cvery inaccurate\u201d (in fact, the rough transcript Trump released proved the whistleblower\u2019s account was highly accurate); that the whistleblower \u201chas disappeared\u201d (no); and that Democrat Adam Schiff was, somehow, the one to \u201cpick\u201d the whistleblower (also no).   The most revealing false claim: The Dunns\u2019 non-meeting   Trump, a former reality television star who has demonstrated better instincts for drama than for empathy, apparently tried to stage a surprise encounter between Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American diplomat, and the parents of Harry Dunn, the British 19-year-old who was killed in a car crash in which police believe Sacoolas was involved.   The Dunns had accepted an invitation to the White House. They were aghast, though, when Trump unexpectedly told them Sacoolas was also in the building, and they declined Trump\u2019s offer to bring her into the room.   Trump compounded the offense in an interview on British radio last week with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage. Trump said: \u201cWell, I had a meeting set up but all of a sudden, I guess, lawyers got involved. But I had a meeting set up.\u201d   There was never a meeting set up, said family spokesman Radd Seiger, who told CNN that Trump\u2019s claim was \u201ca lie.\u201d   The most absurd false claim: The CNN camera   We\u2019ve already delved into this one, so we won\u2019t belabor the point, but let\u2019s think about it one more time.   The President looked at his supporters at the Mississippi rally, pointed at the back of the room, and told them he had just seen something: the light on CNN\u2019s camera being turned off as he criticized CNN.   He had not seen that. CNN\u2019s photojournalist on the scene has his \u201ctally light\u201d permanently set to off, so it is never visible, and he never stopped recording as Trump was speaking.   Trump lies a lot about policy and politics. To lie that he is seeing something he is not seeing is next-level weird.   Below is this week\u2019s full list of 50 false claims, starting with the ones we haven\u2019t included in a weekly update before:   Adam Schiff and the whistleblower   \u201cDidn\u2019t he pick the Whistleblower?\u201d \u2013 November 2 tweet   Facts First: While the whistleblower did seek guidance from the staff of the House Intelligence Committee (which Schiff chairs) before filing an official complaint, that is not at all the same thing as Schiff somehow \u201cpicking\u201d the whistleblower.   Polling on impeachment   \u201cThe impeachment polls have been very, very strong \u2013 and especially in the swing states, I think you see that. The swing states \u2013 they don\u2019t want to hear about it. And we have polls \u2013 people don\u2019t want to hear about impeachment. The only one that wants impeachment \u2013 to talk about it \u2013 is the fake media and the Democrats, who \u2013 basically, they work for the media.\u201d \u2013 November 3 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure   Facts First: Swing-state polling on impeachment by the New York Times and Siena College in October did contain some good news for Trump: the pollsters found that in the six closest states Trump won in 2016, registered voters \u201coppose impeaching Mr. Trump and removing him from office, 53 percent to 43 percent.\u201d   But Trump exaggerated when he said that only Democrats and the media even want to talk about impeachment. Those same swing-state polls found that 50% of registered voters supported Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry versus 45% who were opposed; among independents, it was 51% support to 43% opposition.   In some recent polls by prominent pollsters, including Gallup and Quinnipiac University, more independents have supported impeaching Trump and removing him from office than independents who opposed the idea. Other polls have found that more independents are opposed; even in those polls, though, there has been substantial support among independents for impeachment and removal.   A quote from Guy Lewis   \u201c\u2018Adam Schiff has taken all of the power for himself. That is very unfair. There were dozens of people on this call, yesterdays witness knew that and had no problems (nor did any of them). Facts matter, and that\u2019s why this is not about Impeachment.\u2019 Guy Lewis, former prosecutor @FoxNews\u201d \u2013 November 1 tweets   Facts First: Trump added his own comments into this quote. In this segment on Fox News, Lewis did not say Schiff had \u201ctaken all of the power for himself\u201d or mention anything witnesses supposedly \u201cknew.\u201d   Lewis actually said the Democrats\u2019 resolution to establish procedures for their impeachment inquiry gave Schiff \u201calmost unfettered power in terms of what information gets released, what documents get subpoenaed, what witnesses get subpoenaed.\u201d He did not say the words \u201ctaken all of the power for himself.\u201d When Lewis referred to the \u201cdozens of people on this call,\u201d he did not say that \u201cyesterday\u2019s witness knew that and had no problems (nor did any of them)\u201d; he simply said \u201cthere were dozens of people on this call listening and there was nothing illegal discussed.\u201d   Joe Biden, Burisma and the golf photo   Trump suggested that one of Joe Biden\u2019s claims related to his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine had been contradicted by a photo of Biden posing at a golf course with Hunter Biden and two other men. Trump claimed Joe Biden had said \u201cI never met the people, never met the gentleman,\u201d but then, \u201cin about 10 seconds, a picture came out where they\u2019re playing golf together.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: The photo did not contradict anything Biden had said.   Trump appeared to be referring, as he has previously, to Devon Archer, one of the other men in the photo. Archer is a longtime business associate of Hunter Biden who served with Hunter on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma. Joe Biden never said he had never met Devon Archer.   Trump has previously claimed that the photo showed Biden golfing with the \u201ccompany boss\u201d of Burisma, which it does not. (There is a fourth man in the photo who has not been identified, but he is not Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky or top executive Taras Burdeinyi.)   Trump\u2019s meeting with the Queen   \u201cNo, I really did and you know I met the Queen as a second time and the first time everything is so perfect and we got along so well and I was supposed to be there for 16.3 minutes. You know, I kid when I say that, but like 15 or 16 minutes, everything was so precise, and I was there for more than an hour and I came out.\u201d \u2013 October 31 interview with Nigel Farage on LBC   Facts First: Trump\u2019s 2018 tea with the Queen was not scheduled for a \u201cprecise\u201d 15 or 16 minutes; it was scheduled for 30 minutes, according to various UK and US news outlets. It lasted for 47 minutes or 48 minutes, news outlets reported. (We might let this little claim go if Trump had been speaking informally, but he specifically claimed the \u201c15 or 16 minutes\u201d was a \u201cprecise\u201d figure.)   The Dunn family   \u201cWell, I had a meeting set up but all of a sudden, I guess, lawyers got involved. But I had a meeting set up. They were both in the White House.\u201d \u2013 October 31 interview with Nigel Farage on LBC   Facts First: The family of a UK teen, Harry Dunn, who was killed in a collision with a car police believe was driven by Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US diplomat, had never agreed to any meeting \u201cset up\u201d by Trump, family spokesman Radd Seiger said. Seiger told CNN that Trump\u2019s claim was \u201ca lie.\u201d   What happened, Seiger said in an interview, is that Trump surprised the family during its visit to the White House by unexpectedly telling them that Sacoolas was in a nearby room.   Seiger said he had received a phone call from a White House aide inviting the family to meet with a \u201csenior government official\u201d whose name the aide would not disclose. The official turned out to be Trump himself.   \u201cIf the aide had said, \u2018We\u2019ve got the driver, would you like to come and meet her,\u2019 I would have said, \u2018Respectfully, now is not the right time,\u2019\u201d Seiger said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t told what the reason for the meeting was. We were just simply asked to come down.\u201d   Dunn\u2019s parents were \u201cterrified\u201d when Trump told them he had Sacoolas in the building ready for a meeting, Seiger said, and he told Trump that they did not want to meet her at the moment.   Brexit and trade with the UK   \u201cWe\u2019re far and away the number-one economy in the world. And if you do it [Brexit] a certain way, we\u2019re prohibited from trading with the UK. That would be very bad for the UK because we can do much more business than the European Union.\u201d \u2013 November 3 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure   Facts First: The US would not be prohibited from trading with the United Kingdom under any proposed form of Brexit deal. Steve Peers, a University of Essex law professor who is an expert on European Union law and trade law, called Trump\u2019s claim a \u201clie.\u201d   \u201cThe withdrawal agreement between the EU and UK would mean the UK staying in the EU\u2019s customs union and trade policy for a transition period to the end of 2020, with a possible extension of one or two years. This would mean the UK trading as it does now with the US; trade between the two countries is obviously not currently prohibited. After that it would be up to the UK what happens,\u201d Peers said in an email.   Peers added: \u201cIt may have been that Trump meant that *some* trade would be prevented, but that\u2019s not what he said; or that a trade *deal* would be prevented.\u201d   Trump said in an interview last week with Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit Party, that \u201cunder certain aspects of the deal, you can\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t trade.\u201d But he quickly added, \u201cI mean, we can\u2019t make a trade deal with the UK.\u201d   So perhaps that was what he meant here too \u2013 but Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government rejected even that claim. \u201cThe PM\u2019s deal takes back control of our money, laws and border and allows us to do trade deals with any country we chose - including the US,\u201d the BBC reported that a spokesman for Johnson said.   CNN\u2019s camera   \u201cBut listen, CNN, the worst. I mean the worst, the worst. Oh, their light just went off, see? What \u2013 the light was on, they just \u2013 they don\u2019t like it. You know it\u2019s tough. Your fake CNN \u2013 no, it\u2019s tough. I tried not to do that because I see their light on. You know, when their light goes on that means you\u2019re live. No, that means you\u2019re live, and every time \u2013 it\u2019s tough. Look, in all fairness\u2026It\u2019s hard to be broadcasting that when you\u2019re talking about the network that has you on, right?\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: CNN\u2019s photojournalist at the rally did not stop recording as Trump criticized CNN. Also, the light on his camera is set so that it does not go on and off at all. CNN did not carry the rally live on television at all, and it did not stop its live online stream as Trump criticized CNN.   Trump did not make an innocent mistake: this is at least the eighth time as President he has made a baseless claim about the lights on television cameras being turned off as he has criticized the media.   Unemployment in Mississippi   \u201cUnemployment in Mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded, ever recorded.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: This was true last year and early this year, but it is not true now. Mississippi\u2019s unemployment rate went as low as 4.7% last fall, which was indeed a record, but it has since increased to 5.4% \u2013 higher than it was during portions of 1999, 2000 and 2001, and the same as it was during portions of 1979. The official White House Twitter account offered a correct version of the claim, saying the state\u2019s unemployment rate \u201chit its lowest level EVER last year!\u201d   The jobs report   \u201cWow, a blowout JOBS number just out, adjusted for revisions and the General Motors strike, 303,000. This is far greater than expectations. USA ROCKS!\u201d \u2013 November 1 tweet   Facts First: Trump\u2019s figure was an exaggeration.   The jobs report released the morning of Trump\u2019s tweet showed that 128,000 jobs were added in October. The August and September figures were revised to add another 95,000 jobs. And the Bureau of Labor Statistics has said that the strike at General Motors affected 46,000 jobs in October.   Add all of those together and you get 269,000. So how did Trump get 303,000?   According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, the GM strike hit 60,000 jobs, not 46,000, because \u201cthe negative effects of the strike reverberated throughout the economy.\u201d And the White House decided not to count the elimination of the 20,000 temporary jobs for Census workers that ended in October.   This decision on the Census job numbers bewildered economists. When those 20,000 people were hired, the White House didn\u2019t say they shouldn\u2019t count toward Trump\u2019s total on the grounds that they were temporary. Trump cannot fairly include them when they are being created and ignore them when they are disappearing.   \u201cThe statement makes little sense and is not tethered to any empirical reality,\u201d Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, told Politico of Trump\u2019s tweet.   It is possible that the GM strike did cause more than 46,000 October job reductions, but it is far from certain that the number of additional reductions was 14,000. The New York Times said the White House\u2019s 60,000 total was \u201clarger than most independent estimates.\u201d   The mass shooting in Dayton   \u201cAnd, last month, I was profoundly honored to award the Medal of Valor to the six police officers who brought down the mass shooter in Dayton, Ohio, in 29 seconds. I don\u2019t know how many people saw that, but I thought it was incredible. And he\u2019s \u2013 he did a lot of destruction. But he would \u2013 it would\u2019ve been the worst in history. Twenty-nine \u2013 I\u2019ll never forget the scene. They showed four of them going down the street; there were six altogether. But it was on tape\u2026They were shooting so fast. Twenty-nine seconds \u2013 he was dead.\u201d  \u2013 October 28 speech to the International Association of Chiefs of Police   Facts First: Dayton police said they shot the mass murderer, Connor Betts, 32 seconds after he began his August attack, not 29 seconds. Trump himself said while awarding the officers with Medals of Valor in September, \u201cWithin 32 seconds of the start of the attack, these six officers ended the violent rampage and saved countless lives. \u201c   Trump might well have been sincerely mistaken this time, but since he said \u201c29\u201d three times here, and the shooting was a situation in which each second was important.   Crime in Chicago   Told that Chicago leaders \u201cwould say that crime numbers are down this year, that they\u2019ve made progress,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cSure, down from what? Down from the highest crime numbers we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d \u2013 October 28 interview with ABC 7 Chicago   Facts First: Chicago had been experiencing a serious problem with homicide and other violent crime the year before Trump took office, but Trump was hyperbolic in describing the city\u2019s previous numbers as \u201cthe highest crime numbers we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Even before the declines of 2017, 2018 and the first 10 months of 2019, crime numbers were significantly lower in 2016 than they were at several previous points in the city\u2019s history.   In 2016, there were 769 homicides in Chicago. Trump could have accurately said that was nearly a two-decade record \u2013 it was the highest number since 1997. But it was far from the highest number \u201cever\u201d: 2016 ranked 19th in terms of the number of Chicago homicides, according to the Chicago Tribune. In 1974, for example, there were 940 homicides by the Tribune\u2019s count (which often differs slightly from the police count because of differences in methodology. And the Chicago homicide rate, which takes population into account, was higher in nine individual years than it was in 2016, according to Tribune data.   The situation is similar for other kinds of violent crime. According to Chicago Police annual reports, the city had 42,237 aggravated assaults in 1991, 6,600 in 2016.   Chicago and the decline in homicide   \u201cOver the last two years, the number of murders in America and America\u2019s major cities has dropped, unlike here, by more than 10%. And if we ever took the Chicago numbers out of our total numbers, the numbers would be incredible. And they already are \u2013 even including Chicago.\u201d \u2013 October 28 speech to the International Association of Chiefs of Police   Facts First: Trump was entirely inaccurate about Chicago\u2019s role in the national decline in homicide between 2016 and 2018. Though Chicago does have a high number of homicides, it saw a significant decline between those two years \u2013 a bigger decline than for the country as a whole. In other words, the decline in Chicago\u2019s numbers improved, rather than worsened, the overall national percentage change.   The number of homicides in the US dropped from 17,413 in 2016 to 16,214 in 2018, according to the FBI\u2019s annual report; that\u2019s a 6.9% decline, not a decline of more than 10%. We don\u2019t yet have numbers for this year, though, so we won\u2019t call Trump incorrect on that point \u2013 and Trump might have simply slipped when he first said \u201cin America\u201d rather than simply \u201cin America\u2019s major cities.\u201d Depending on how you define \u201cmajor cities\u201d and when you start and finish counting, he might be correct.   Regardless: the national decline would actually be smaller, not larger, if Chicago\u2019s numbers were removed from the equation. Chicago had 769 homicides in 2016 and 565 in 2018 \u2013 a 27% decline, much larger than the figure for the whole country. In 2018, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Chicago\u2019s decline in 2017 was responsible for more than half the entire national decline in 2017.   \u201cHe [Jim Hood] supports illegal immigration\u2026\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: We also give Trump wide latitude to express opinions about political opponents, but there is no basis for saying Hood, the Democratic attorney general and unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate in Mississippi, \u201csupports illegal immigration.\u201d   Hood\u2019s opponent, Republican winner Tate Reeves, argued that Hood has been insufficiently tough in enforcing laws related to illegal immigration; that\u2019s a matter of opinion. But Trump\u2019s claim that Hood \u201csupports illegal immigration\u201d is groundless.   Here are the claims Trump made last week that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:   The rough transcript   \u201cThey tried to take that conversation and make it into a big scandal.  The problem was we had it transcribed. It was an exact transcription of the conversation.\u201d \u2013 October 28 exchange with reporters before Air Force One departure   \u201cWe have a transcript. There was an exact transcript of the meeting. And anybody that reads the transcripts understands. It was a perfect phone call with the Ukrainian president, who is a very fine man, a very nice person.\u201d \u2013 October 31 interview with Nigel Farage on LBC   Facts First: The document released by the White House explicitly says, on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky.   In testimony in late October, the National Security Council\u2019s top Ukraine expert, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, said that he tried to make edits to the document to include two things that were said on the call but not included in the document, a source told CNN.   Trump appeared to inadvertently use the word \u201cmeeting\u201d in his interview with Farage; he quickly made clear he was talking about the phone call.   People talking about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call   \u201cThe conversation was perfect. They don\u2019t ever talk about the conversation.\u201d \u2013 October 28 exchange with reporters before Air Force One departure   Facts First: Trump didn\u2019t specify who \u201cthey\u201d were, but the claim is inaccurate enough to call it false anyway. Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was the subject of widespread discussion among members of Congress and in the media at the time. It was a central focus of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry   The accuracy of the whistleblower   \u201c\u2026when they saw what the whistleblower wrote, and then when I released the conversation, which bore no relationship to what the whistleblower saw, they said their case was out the window.  And I think it\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d And: \u201cSo, in a nutshell, a whistleblower wrote a false narrative of the conversation. \u201d \u2013 October 28 exchange with reporters before Air Force One departure   \u201cWell, the whistleblower gave a very inaccurate report.\u201d And: \u201cI don\u2019t know why the media is not on it, because the whistleblower gave a very inaccurate report about my phone call.\u201d And: \u201cThe whistleblower gave a false report. And because of that false report, people thought bad things were done.\u201d And: \u201cBut the whistleblower should be revealed because the whistleblower gave false stories.  Some people would call it a fraud; I won\u2019t go that far. But when I read it closely, I probably would.\u201d \u2013 November 3 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure   \u201cThe Whistleblower got it sooo wrong that HE must come forward.\u201d \u2013 November 3 tweet   Facts First: The whistleblower\u2019s account of the call has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower\u2019s three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct.   You can read a full fact check here.   Schiff\u2019s comments and the law   \u201cAnd Adam Schiff went before Congress, and Adam Schiff, what he did, will never be forgotten. He made up a conversation that was a phony fabrication. It was a fraud. And people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get away. They say he has immunity because he\u2019s a member of Congress. People shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do that. That\u2019s a criminal act. What he did is a criminal act.\u201d \u2013 October 28 exchange with reporters before Air Force One departure   \u201cThe only crimes in the Impeachment Hoax were committed by Shifty Adam Schiff, when he totally made up my phone conversation with the Ukrainian President and read it to Congress, together with numerous others on Shifty\u2019s side. Schiff should be Impeached, and worse!\u201d\u2013 October 28 tweet   Facts First: While it\u2019s fair for Trump to be miffed about Schiff\u2019s comments at a congressional committee meeting \u2013 Schiff\u2019s mix of near-quotes from Trump, his own analysis, and supposed \u201cparody\u201d was at the very least confusing \u2013 Schiff\u2019s words were not illegal or criminal. The Constitution includes a specific provision that allows members of Congress to speak freely during official meetings.   Trump briefly acknowledged that \u201cthey say he has immunity,\u201d but he then proceeded to insist Schiff committed a crime anyway.   The timing Schiff\u2019s comments   \u201cAnd just to finish it off, Adam Schiff went up before Congress and he made my words. He didn\u2019t copy what I said. He didn\u2019t know them, probably, at the time. Nobody thought I was going to release the conversation. I got the approval from Ukraine. Once I released the conversation, this thing all died.\u201d \u2013 October 28 exchange with reporters before Air Force One departure   \u201cAnd then you had Schiff go out and speak before Congress and before the American people and give a false story. He made up a story. And then I released after \u2013 after all this was done, I released, and everybody said, \u2018He didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\u2013 November 3 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure   Facts First: Schiff made his comments at a congressional committee hearing about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky the day after Trump released the rough transcript, not before. Before he started claiming that Schiff did not expect a transcript to be released, Trump had complained that Schiff did not read the transcript available to him.   It is obviously false that \u201ceverybody\u201d said \u2018He didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u2019 after Trump released the rough transcript of the call, or that \u201cthis thing all died\u201d after he did so.   The whistleblower   \u201c\u2018There is no underlying crime in that transcript.\u2019@IngrahamAngle100% correct, and the Whistleblower disappeared after I released the transcript of the call. Where is the Whistleblower?\u201d \u2013 October 28 tweet   \u201cThe Whistleblower has disappeared. Where is the Whistleblower?\u201d \u2013 November 2 tweet   Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers say they have firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow \u201cgone,\u201d let alone that they are \u201cgone\u201d because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.   \u201cThe whistleblowers have not vanished,\u201d Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter.   Mexican soldiers and the border   \u201cAnd I want to thank the country of Mexico. They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders; 27,000; do you know that is? And they are keeping people out \u2013 and I want to thank the president of Mexico.\u201d  \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN reported on November 2: \u201cNearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico\u2019s northern border, where they\u2019ve set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country\u2019s security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.\u201d   Acting US Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in September that 10,000 of approximately 25,000 troops were on Mexico\u2019s own southern border.   Democrats and undocumented immigrants   \u201cThey want to give these people that come into our country illegally more advantages than our own citizens have, more advantages than our own military has.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: There is no apparent basis for this claim. Some Democrats want to give undocumented immigrants the same access to health care and other programs that citizens have, not more.   It was not clear who Trump was talking about when he referred to \u201cour own military.\u201d He repeatedly claimed during the presidential election that undocumented immigrants were being treated better than veterans; a Washington Post fact check concluded that this claim was \u201cabsurd.\u201d   Approval with Republicans   \u201c95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a record. Thank you!\u201d \u2013 October 29 tweet   \u201cI\u2019m the highest rated person in the history of the Republican Party \u2013 came out the other day, 95%; I have a 95% approval rating in the Republican Party\u2026\u201d \u2013 October 31 interview with Nigel Farage on LBC   \u201cRepublicans have never been more unified, and my Republican Approval Rating is now 95%!\u201d \u2013 November 3 tweet   Facts First: Trump\u2019s approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find. And his approval rating with Republicans is not a record.   Trump was at 90% approval with Republicans in a CNN poll conducted from October 17-20, 83% with Republicans in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted from October 17-21, 74% with Republicans in a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted from October 27-30, and 83% in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted October 28-29.   Trump\u2019s approval with Republicans is not a record. Gallup\u2019s website features data on approval rating by party for every president since Harry Truman. George W. Bush has the record for Republican approval over this 74-year period: he hit 99% after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. His father, George H.W. Bush, hit 97% at the end of the Gulf War in 1991. Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Dwight Eisenhower all went higher than 90%.   Energy production   \u201c\u2026and we ended the war on American energy. We are now the number one producer of energy by far, anywhere in the world.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: The US has not just \u201cnow\u201d become the world\u2019s top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump\u2019s policies: it took the top spot in 2012, under the very president he has accused of perpetuating the \u201cwar.\u201d The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump\u2019s tenure.   Veterans Choice   \u201cWe passed VA choice\u2026People said it couldn\u2019t be done, VA Choice.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: President Barack Obama signed the Choice program into law in 2014; in 2018, Trump signed another bill, the VA MISSION Act, that expanded and modified the Choice program.   Overdose deaths   \u201cAnd last year, drug overdose deaths fell for the first time in nearly 31 years. It\u2019s a great thing.\u201d \u2013 October 28 speech to the International Association of Chiefs of Police   Facts First: This was yet another of Trump\u2019s trademark small exaggerations. Media outlets reported that overdose deaths had declined in 2018 for the first time since 1990, or 28 years, according to preliminary data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.   We might be inclined to let this go if Trump did not do such exaggerating so frequently. As he did in the same speech with drug prices, he regularly adds additional years to his accomplishments.   China\u2019s economic performance   \u201cThey had the worst year that they\u2019ve had in 57 years.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: China\u2019s second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992, 27 years ago.   Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.   Who is paying for Trump\u2019s tariffs on China   Trump claimed that the tariff revenue being allocated to farmers who have been affected by his trade war with China is coming \u201ccompliments of China.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: A bevy of economic studies have found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.   The history of tariffs on China   \u201cSo, we will have pretty soon, over $100 billion in money paid into the United States Treasury by a country that never gave us 10 cents, they only took.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: Again, these tariffs are paid by Americans. Aside from the question of who is paying, it\u2019s not true that the Treasury has never received \u201c10 cents\u201d from tariffs on China. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; the Treasury received $14 billion from tariffs on China in 2014, to look at one pre-Trump year.   Trump\u2019s claim also ignores China\u2019s hundreds of billions of dollars in purchases of US goods \u2013 more than $300 billion during Trump\u2019s presidency alone.   \u201cPretty soon\u201d is subjective, but the US had generated just over $35 billion from Trump\u2019s new tariffs on China as of October 30, according to official data published by Customs and Border Protection.   USMCA ratification   \u201cI hope they approve USMCA. It\u2019s in there. It\u2019s a great agreement for the United States, for our farmers, for our manufacturers, for unions, for everything. It\u2019s been approved by Mexico and Canada. They\u2019re waiting.\u201d \u2013 October 28 exchange with reporters before Air Force One departure   Facts First: Mexico\u2019s Senate has voted to approve the USMCA trade agreement, but Canada\u2019s Parliament has not. (The agreement is highly unlikely to be rejected by Parliament, but still, the voting has not happened yet.)   Michelle Obama and the 2018 campaign in Georgia   \u201c\u2026Stacey Abrams, who by the way, went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentleman from the great state of Georgia, Brian Kemp. And they came in with \u2013 oh, they brought them all. They had President Obama, they had Michelle Obama, they had Oprah Winfrey, they came in, and all he (Republican Brian Kemp) had was Donald Trump, and we won.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: Michelle Obama did not campaign for Abrams at all, though Barack Obama and Winfrey did.   Rep. Al Green\u2019s comments   \u201cAnd they know they can\u2019t win. So, let\u2019s try and impeach him. How about that crazy Representative Al Green, right? You know, \u2018We\u2019ve got to impeach him because we can\u2019t beat him.\u2019 I don\u2019t think so, right? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: Trump was at least slightly exaggerating Green\u2019s comments. In May, Green said this: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if we don\u2019t impeach this President, he will get reelected.\u201d In September, when Trump previously claimed Green had said \u201cwe can\u2019t\u201d beat Trump without impeachment, Green told CNN, \u201cI never said we can\u2019t beat the President.\u201d   Democrats and borders   Trump said on two occasions that the Democrats have a policy of \u201copen borders.\u201d   Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.   Forests and fires in California   \u201cAnd what she\u2019s (Nancy Pelosi) done \u2013 and what she\u2019s done for that district \u2013 and then, on top of it, you\u2019ve got fires eating away at California every year because management is so bad.\u201d \u2013 November 3 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure   \u201cThe Governor of California, @GavinNewsom, has done a terrible job of forest management. I told him from the first day we met that he must \u2018clean\u2019 his forest floors regardless of what his bosses, the environmentalists, DEMAND of him\u2026. Also, open up the ridiculously closed water lanes coming down from the North. Don\u2019t pour it out into the Pacific Ocean. Should be done immediately. California desperately needs water, and you can have it now!\u201d \u201d \u2013 November 3 tweet   Facts First: While exact causes have yet to be determined, most of the California fires of recent weeks occurred in suburban or residential areas. CAL FIRE spokesman Scott McLean told CNN that only one of the blazes which appeared to prompt the President\u2019s response could be considered a forest fire. \u201cA lot of our wildland fires are strictly that,\u201d McLean said.   California firefighters were not experiencing any issues with their supply of water as they fought the blazes, McLean said.   Further, the federal government owns more than half of California\u2019s forest land. And scientists say climate change is a significant contributing factor to the wildfire problem in California.   You can read our full fact check here.   \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing for the UK. The concept of what they\u2019re doing. I was in favor of it [Brexit] originally. Remember, I was out opening up Turnberry at the time and we had a massive amount of press more than you would normally have for opening a \u2013 a club, and I said that it was going to pass and everybody laughed, and I was right.\u201d \u2013 October 31 interview with Nigel Farage on LBC   Facts First: Trump was not at his Turnberry golf club in Scotland before the Brexit vote in June 2016; he visited the club and spoke to the press the day after the vote. (He might just have been forgetting, but he has made repeated false claims about his trip to Scotland and his comments on Brexit.)   Trump did predict in March 2016 that the United Kingdom would vote to leave the European Union. The day before the vote three months later, however, he made no prediction. He said in an interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should listen to me,\u201d because \u201cI haven\u2019t really focused on it very much,\u201d but that his \u201cinclination\u201d would be that Britain should vote to leave the European Union.   Judicial vacancies   \u201cI want to thank you, President Obama, for giving me 142 open judges. How you allowed that to happen is beyond me. It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d \u2013 October 28 speech to the International Association of Chiefs of Police   \u201cIn a very short while, we\u2019ll have 182 federal judges. President Obama left us 142. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Can you believe that? You\u2019re supposed to leave none when you leave office, but that didn\u2019t work out too well.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: Trump exaggerated. There were 104 judicial vacancies on January 1, 2017, just before Trump was inaugurated, according to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments.   Trump is entitled to his opinion on what \u201cyou\u2019re supposed to leave,\u201d but it is normal for presidents to leave some judicial vacancies to their successors. According to Wheeler, there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office.   \u201cUnemployment has reached the lowest rate in over 51 years, soon to be historic.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: This is Trump\u2019s usual slight exaggeration of an already-impressive number. The 3.6% unemployment rate for October is the lowest in just under 50 years (if you ignore the fact that it was slightly lower, 3.5%, in September).   \u201cI will always protect Medicare for our seniors, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. We will always take care of them.\u201d \u2013 November 1 campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi   Facts First: We usually don\u2019t fact-check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions; Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void, and he has not issued a plan to reinstate the law\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.   Trump said the Democratic governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, had done a poor job with automotive insurance, which Trump said was \u201chighest in nation.\u201d \u2013 October 30 tweet   Facts First: Louisiana has the second-highest average annual car insurance premiums in the country, not the highest, according to Insure.com rankings regularly cited by Louisiana news outlets. Michigan has ranked first for six consecutive years, Louisiana second for three consecutive years.   According to Insure.com, the average Michigan premium for 2019 was $2,611; the average Louisiana premium was $2,298. The national average was $1,457.   Trump claimed that the US is spending \u201c4%\u201d of gross domestic product on defense, \u201ctwice as much as we should be and we\u2019re supposed to\u201d under NATO\u2019s goal of having each member spend 2% of GDP on defense. \u2013 October 31 interview with Nigel Farage on LBC   Facts First: This was another slight exaggeration. The US is spending an estimated 3.42% of its gross domestic product on defense in 2019, according to official NATO estimates from June. The US is exceeding NATO\u2019s 2% guideline by 71%.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans \u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network.", "Trump made 96 false claims last week | CNN Politics": " President Donald Trump was relentlessly dishonest last week about the scandal over his dealings with Ukraine, making false claims about just about every component of the story.   Trump made 96 false claims last week, the second-highest total of the 16 weeks we\u2019ve counted at CNN. He made 53 false claims last Monday alone \u2013 a remarkable 31 in rambling comments at his Cabinet meeting and 22 more in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity.   Fifty-three false claims is by far the most Trump has made in any day in the 16 weeks we\u2019ve tracked, beating the previous high of 41. Trump has averaged about 68 false claims per week over the 16-week period \u2013 just shy of 10 false claims per day.   His deception last week was focused on his conduct toward Ukraine and Democrats\u2019 related impeachment inquiry. Deep breath now:   He falsely claimed he had released an exact transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He falsely claimed he did not ask Zelensky for anything on the call. He falsely claimed people aren\u2019t talking about the call anymore.   He falsely claimed the whistleblower complaint about the call was \u201ctotally wrong.\u201d He falsely claimed the whistleblower alleged he had made seven or eight mentions of a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d He falsely claimed the whistleblower has vanished. He falsely claimed Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff was the whistleblower\u2019s source.   He falsely claimed Schiff had spoken about the call at a committee hearing before, not after, the release of the rough transcript. He falsely claimed Schiff\u2019s committee comments were illegal. He falsely claimed Republicans aren\u2019t allowed to ask questions in Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry hearings. And he falsely claimed those closed-door hearings are unprecedented.   The most egregious false claim: Trump\u2019s \u201cprediction\u201d about Osama bin Laden   The President complained that the media doesn\u2019t want to talk about his declaration, in a 2000 book, that Osama bin Laden needed to be killed. In fact, he didn\u2019t say anything like that.   The President claimed that things would be different today if his prescient words had been listened to. Again, those words do not exist.   The President claimed that he still has people coming up to him marveling at his amazing \u201cprediction\u201d about bin Laden. Again, he did not make any prediction about bin Laden.   And the president claimed that it was an especially remarkable prediction because \u201cnobody\u201d had ever heard of bin Laden at the time. Bin Laden was being pursued by the CIA and had been put on the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list the year before.   Here\u2019s a full fact check of Trump\u2019s elaborate fiction.   The most revealing false claim: How people \u201cdon\u2019t talk\u201d about his call with Ukraine\u2019s president   Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky is at the center of Democrats\u2019 push to impeach him. It remains the subject of discussion in the media and in the impeachment inquiry hearings.   Trump said last week: \u201cThey don\u2019t talk about it anymore.\u201d   \u201cThey don\u2019t like to talk about the phone call,\u201d he told Hannity, \u201cbecause it was perfect.\u201d   Most politicians spin, exaggerate, mislead. Trump invites people to join him in a fantasyland that bears no resemblance to what they can see with their own eyes.   The most absurd false claim: George Washington\u2019s \u201ctwo desks\u201d   Trump is fond of adding vivid little details to his tales to theoretically make them sound more authentic.   Attempting last week to defend himself against criticism of his aborted plan to hold a G7 summit at one of his own resorts, he claimed that George Washington not only ran a business while in office \u2013 Washington was a major landowner and took an active interest in his farm, so there\u2019s at least a smidgen of truth there \u2013 but that Washington, \u201cthey say, had two desks. He had a presidential desk and a business desk.\u201d   For good measure, Trump gestured as if there were two desks near him, side-by-side.   Fact checking Trump involves asking weird questions to experts who do not traditionally get roped into articles on the dishonesty of elected officials. In this case, one of our recruits was Mary Thompson, a research historian at Mount Vernon, Washington\u2019s historic home.   \u201cI am not aware of Washington having had two desks in the study in the presidential mansion, which was a fairly small room,\u201d Thompson said.   Here\u2019s a full fact check of this claim. And below is this week\u2019s full list of 96, starting with the ones we haven\u2019t included in a weekly update before:   Trump\u2019s poll numbers   \u201cAnd I had great polls. I have my best polls now. I think it\u2019s because people think that it\u2019s terrible what they\u2019re doing. Pelosi, Shifty Schiff, Schumer \u2013 these people are trying to destroy the country.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   \u201cI do say this \u2013 and I can see it, because I\u2019ve been \u2013 I mean, look at our fundraising. The money\u2019s never come in like this. Look at \u2013 my poll numbers have been, like, the highest.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   Facts First: Trump did not say what polls he was referring to, but there is no sign that he is at his \u201chighest\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d level ever or that there has been any kind of spike in his numbers as a result of Democrats\u2019 impeachment push.   Trump was at 41.8% approval and 54.1% disapproval in the FiveThirtyEight polling aggregate on the day of these comments, October 21. That was down from 43.8% approval and 52.1% disapproval on September 25, his recent peak. Trump was above 44% approval at various points of 2017 and 2018.   Trump\u2019s approval numbers with Republicans in particular are consistently over 80%, but even these numbers were not at their peak at the time he spoke here.   People crying   \u201cWe revoked the ridiculous Waters of the United States rule. \u2026 When I did that, I had people in my office \u2013 I had miners and I had farmers and I had builders building homes. And many of them were tough, strong men and women. And almost all of them were crying. They said, \u2018Sir, you\u2019ve given our life back to us.\u2019\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: We checked the video of this 2017 event, and nobody standing behind Trump was crying. (Trump had previously claimed that \u201chalf\u201d of the people behind him were crying.)   A report from \u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d   Trump spoke three times about data on household income growth under himself and Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. He said all three times that the figures were from \u201cMoody\u2019s.\u201d   Facts First: These figures were not from Moody\u2019s, company spokesman Gene Kim confirmed; they were produced by a different firm, Sentier Research. (Trump might well just have been confused \u2013 he did refer correctly to a recent Moody\u2019s analysis that found he is on track to win the 2020 election if the economy remains roughly as it is today.)   The Sentier Research data had been recently referenced by Stephen Moore, an economic fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a Fox News contributor.   Median household income and energy   \u201cA recent analysis found that middle class income has risen by $5,000. But add to that \u2013 that\u2019s median household income \u2013 add to that $2,000 from the tax cuts and then $2,000 for energy, because our energy is much cheaper. \u2026 And so that would be $9,000 per household. Median income.\u201d \u2013 October 25 speech to 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum   Facts First: There is no basis to add \u201c$2,000 for energy\u201d on top of the $5,000 figure for median household income.   The $5,000 figure came from Sentier Research, a private company run by former Census Bureau officials. The company uses a different methodology than the Census Bureau, and the Trump-era household income increase it calculated is much larger than the increase the Census Bureau itself found between 2016 and 2018.   Whichever figure is more accurate, there is no credible estimate that the median household gained \u201c$2,000 for energy\u201d over and above the $5,000 overall pre-tax gain found by Sentier. Household energy costs have increased since Trump took office, as have gasoline costs.   The Sentier data and inflation   \u201cYou know, a number just came out \u2026 under the Bush administration, for eight years, median household income went up $400. That\u2019s over eight years. OK? So, remember: $400, eight years \u2026 so remember this: eight years, eight years, 400 bucks \u2013 400 bucks. You don\u2019t even \u2013 that gets wiped out by inflation. Four hundred dollars.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: As the Washington Post noted, Trump was incorrect that the $400 median household income increase under Bush \u201cgets wiped out by inflation.\u201d The Sentier data is already adjusted for inflation, company partner Gordon Green confirmed.   The construction of the Empire State Building   \u201cAmerica built the Empire State Building in just one year. Believe it or not, in nine months.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: The Empire State Building was built in 13 months, not nine months. (We\u2019d have let it go if Trump had stuck to \u201cjust one year,\u201d but nine months is objectively wrong.)   The pace of road approvals   \u201c\u2026 I mean, roads are under consideration for \u2013 we have roads, 21 years, 22 years. They end up costing many, many times more\u2026 But permits that took 17, 18, 19 years, we think we can get \u2013 we\u2019re down to two years. And we think we can get it around one. And you may get rejected, folks, but it\u2019s going to be fast.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: There is no apparent basis for Trump\u2019s claim that it now takes just two years to get environmental approvals for \u201croads,\u201d though he was not very specific about which roads he was talking about. According to the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) page, the department\u2019s median environmental impact statement completion time was 47 months in 2018, up from 46 months in 2017 and 44 months in 2016.   A White House report in December 2018 found an average environmental impact statement completion time of 4.5 years and median completion time of 3.6 years across the government, for various kinds of projects.   Brad Karkkainen, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on environmental and land use law, said in an email that he has \u201cnever heard of a highway project taking 18 or 20 years, though it\u2019s certainly possible that when the median time was six or seven years, a few projects took twice as long, perhaps more.\u201d He said some projects can \u201csail through\u201d much faster than the median time, \u201cbut to suggest as Trump does that the typical time has gone from 17+ years to two years is just nonsense.\u201d   The governor of Louisiana   \u201c\u2026In Louisiana the other night, the governor was at 66 \u2013 he couldn\u2019t get 50%.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   Facts First: Trump was vague here, but Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards was not \u201cat 66\u201d either in the polls or in his previous election. Edwards got 56% of the vote when he was elected in 2015; public polls listed by FiveThirtyEight did not have him higher than 55% in this year\u2019s open primary.   The Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines   \u201cIn my first week in office, I approved permits for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. And that\u2019s a big thing.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: This was not quite what happened. Trump did sign an executive order in his first week in office to advance both pipelines, but he did not grant final approval of Keystone XL until just over two months into his presidency. The Army announced during Trump\u2019s third week in office that it would grant the final permits for the Dakota Access Pipeline.   A quote from Charlie Kirk   \u201d \u2018\u2026 Our studends (sic) feel EMPOWERED. There\u2019s a movement happening on these campuses like I\u2019ve never seen before. When you have 3000 students wanting to get into an event that couldn\u2019t get in, that\u2019s pretty remarkable!\u2019 @charliekirk11 Turning Point USA KEEP AMERICA GREAT!\u201d \u2013 October 23 tweet   Facts First: Trump\u2019s tweet omitted an important part of Kirk\u2019s quote on Fox News: Kirk\u2019s reference to protests at an event featuring himself and Donald Trump Jr. The President also added a hyperbolic statement Kirk did not utter in this quote.   Introducing Kirk, the founder of conservative organization Turning Point USA, the hosts of Fox & Friends made mention of the protests around the event at Colorado State University. Kirk said: \u201cThere\u2019s a movement happening on these campuses. There were some of the protests from the non-students in the local area, but when you have 3,000 people that wanted to get but couldn\u2019t get out, that\u2019s pretty remarkable!\u201d   Trump replaced Kirk\u2019s reference to the protests with his own words, \u201clike I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d   A quote from Steve Doocy   \u201cA majority do not want him Impeached and removed from office. 94% of the people in these battleground states who voted for President Trump want him to continue as President. That\u2019s squarely in his corner.\u2019\u201d @SteveDoocy \u2013 October 22 tweet   Facts First: Trump\u2019s tweet omitted a significant part of Doocy\u2019s quote: Doocy noted that this poll showed that a majority of those polled supported House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.   Doocy, a co-host of Fox & Friends, actually said, \u201cA majority is for the inquiry but do not want him impeached and removed from office, and it also said that I think 94% of the people in these battleground states who voted for President Trump want him to continue as President. That\u2019s squarely in his corner.\u201d   Republicans and the impeachment inquiry   \u201cBut no lawyers \u2013 we have no lawyers \u2013 Republican \u2013 because it\u2019s the minority. We have no lawyers, we can\u2019t question, we can\u2019t do a thing. We can\u2019t \u2013 they can\u2019t even go into the room\u2026\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   Facts First: Trump was correct that the Democratic House majority was not permitting White House lawyers into its closed hearings. However, the 48 Republican members of the three committees holding the hearings \u2013 Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight \u2013 were indeed allowed into the room, and they were given equal time to question witnesses.   Trump might have been referring to a stunt in which Republicans who were not members of any of the three committees, along with some Republicans who were members, stormed the secure committee room to make a political point; the non-members were not allowed to be there. But the members were allowed to be full participants in the proceedings.   Closed-door impeachment meetings   \u201cWell, I think they are \u2013 I will be honest: I loved when I saw that scene of the unity yesterday with the congressmen going downstairs, because they have a cabal going on. It\u2019s \u2013 you know, you look at what\u2019s happening downstairs in the little room \u2013 that little secret room. Nobody ever had a thing like that. That\u2019s never happened before.\u201d \u2013 October 25 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group\u2019s Eric Bolling   Facts First: It\u2019s not true that \u201cnobody ever had a thing like\u201d the closed-door hearings House Democrats are holding as part of their impeachment inquiry. The impeachment processes for both Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon also involved closed-door meetings in which members of Congress gathered evidence.   \u201cThe President\u2019s comments are entirely, wholly, and completely, wrong,\u201d said Jeffrey Engel, founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. \u201cIt is simply normal for those discussions to take place behind closed doors because as everyone across the board will tell you, in investigations you get better answers when there are no cameras.\u201d   The impeachment witnesses   \u201cThey\u2019re interviewing \u2013 they\u2019re interviewing ambassadors who I\u2019d never heard of. I don\u2019t know who these people are. I never heard of them. And I have great respect for some of them. \u2026 Don\u2019t forget, many of these people were put there during Obama, during Clinton, during the Never Trump or Bush era. You know, you had a Never Trump or Bush.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: As FactCheck.org noted: \u201cActually, among the nine government officials who have testified in closed sessions so far, just two were appointed to their current or recently resigned positions under the Obama administration. The other seven were appointed by Trump or Trump appointees, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\u201d   We can\u2019t definitively fact check whether Trump has heard of his own appointees, but it\u2019s worth noting that they are indeed his own appointees, that he professed respect for \u201csome of them\u201d immediately after saying he\u2019d never heard of them, and that he has a history of minimizing his relationships with former associates when that is convenient for him.   Barack Obama and Kim Jong Un   \u201cBut in the meantime, North Korea, I like Kim, he likes me. We get along. I respect him, he respects me. \u2018You could end up in a war.\u2019 President Obama told me that. He said, \u2018The biggest problem, I don\u2019t know how to solve it.\u2019 He told me he doesn\u2019t know how to solve it. I said, \u2018Did you ever call him?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 Actually, he tried 11 times. But the man on the other side, the gentleman on the other side, did not take his call. OK? Lack of respect. But he takes my call.\u2019\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: There is no apparent basis for the claim that Obama tried to call Kim Jong Un 11 times. In fact, there is no evidence that Obama called him even once. His former national security officials say he did not. Read our full fact check here.   Conor Lamb and Trump   \u201cSo, Conor Lamb \u2013 right here from Pittsburgh. And I appreciate \u2013 Conor, whoever you are \u2013 I have no idea what you even look like. But there\u2019s some guy named Conor Lamb who speaks very nicely about \u2013 you know why? Because you\u2019re in like a Trump district. No, it\u2019s right. It\u2019s true. Right? \u2018No, the President is excellent. He\u2019s doing a good job.\u2019 I thought he was a Republican until I found out.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: Lamb, a Democratic congressman in Pennsylvania who has positioned himself as a moderate, has made an effort to avoid attacking Trump, expressed a willingness to work with Trump, and expressed qualified support for Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum (he called for a focus on China rather than allies like Canada) \u2013 but Lamb has not called Trump \u201cexcellent\u201d or said \u201che\u2019s doing a good job.\u201d   Trump has previously exaggerated how positive Lamb has been toward him, falsely claiming Lamb had endorsed the Trump tax law Lamb had campaigned against.   Conor Lamb and guns   \u201cThey want to take away your guns. Conor Lamb wants to take away your guns.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: There is no evidence that Lamb \u201cwants to take away your guns.\u201d Lamb says he supports universal background checks, but he opposes a ban on assault weapons and says new gun laws are not the answer to the problem of mass shootings.   Obama\u2019s response to Russian election interference   \u201cAnd President Obama in September (2016) was told about Russian influence, and he didn\u2019t want to do anything about it. He didn\u2019t want to do a thing about it. Because he assumed Hillary was going to win. So he didn\u2019t do a thing about it. Nobody brings that up.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   Facts First: Obama has been criticized, even by some Democrats, for not acting more forcefully when he was notified of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Still, it\u2019s an exaggeration to say \u201che didn\u2019t do a thing.\u201d Obama and his senior officials did several things in response to the information.   San Francisco and the environment   \u201cI can\u2019t believe that Nancy Pelosi\u2019s District in San Francisco is in such horrible shape that the City itself is in violation of many sanitary & environmental orders, causing it to owe the Federal Government billions of dollars - and all she works on is Impeachment. We should all work together to clean up these hazardous waste and homeless sites before the whole city rots away. Very bad and dangerous conditions, also severely impacting the Pacific Ocean and water supply. Pelosi must work on this mess and turn her District around!\u201d \u2013 October 26 tweet   Facts First: San Francisco does not owe the federal government billions of dollars over its supposed environmental violations. And the claim that pollution from San Francisco\u2019s homeless population is \u201cseverely impacting the Pacific Ocean and water supply\u201d is sharply disputed by environmental experts.   In September, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, sent a letter to the governor of California to allege \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the state\u2019s implementation of federal environmental laws. The letter, which followed a dispute between the Trump administration and the state over automotive emissions standards, is seen by many Democrats, former EPA officials and environmental experts as retaliatory.   Regardless of the administration\u2019s true motives, the letter did not allege that San Francisco or the state owes the federal government billions. It said San Francisco \u201cmust invest billions of dollars\u201d to modernize its sewer system; that is not the same thing.   Ann Carlson, a professor of environmental law at the University of California, Los Angeles and faculty co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, noted the absence of evidence for the administration\u2019s claims about environmental problems caused by homeless people in San Francisco.   \u201cTrump\u2019s tweet is misleading or flatly false on several fronts. Although he claimed in late September that the city\u2019s failure to manage its homelessness problem was causing serious water pollution problems from needles and human waste, his EPA has produced no evidence to back up its claim,\u201d she said.   \u201cIn fact, after he made that accusation, EPA sent what is called a notice of violation to San Francisco accusing the City of violating the federal Clean Water Act in the operation of its wastewater and sewer system. EPA made no mention of any problems caused by the homeless population \u2013 you can bet if the agency had any evidence, it would have included mention of the evidence in the letter.\u201d   The presidential salary   \u201cBut I give away my presidential salary. They say that no other president has done it. I\u2019m surprised, to be honest with you. They actually say that George Washington may have been the only other president.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: Trump does donate his salary, but the rest of his claim was inaccurate. He is not the only president to have donated the official salary; both John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover did so. Washington did not.   Although Washington initially declined his salary, he relented after Congress insisted.   George Washington\u2019s \u201ctwo desks\u201d   \u201cBut other presidents, if you look \u2013 other presidents were wealthy. Not huge wealth. George Washington was actually considered a very, very rich man at the time. But they ran their businesses. George Washington, they say, had two desks: He had a presidential desk and a business desk.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: Washington, a major landowner, did continue to own property while serving as president, and he took an interest in his farm at Mount Vernon while in office \u2013 even writing to a United Kingdom official to discuss getting help finding renters for Mount Vernon land. But historians say Trump\u2019s claim about Washington having a separate desk for business work is baseless.   You can read a longer fact check here.   Escaped ISIS prisoners   \u201cGeneral Mazloum has assured me that ISIS is under very, very strict lock and key, and the detention facilities are being strongly maintained.  There were a few that got out \u2013 a small number, relatively speaking \u2013 and they\u2019ve been largely recaptured.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech on the situation in Syria   Facts First: Trump\u2019s anti-ISIS envoy, James Jeffrey, testified to Congress about an hour earlier that he does not know the whereabouts of the escaped prisoners. \u201cWe do not know where they are,\u201d Jeffrey, who serves as both special envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS and as special representative for Syria engagement, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   Trump\u2019s statements on Iraq and oil   \u201cI always used to say, \u2018If they\u2019re going to go in\u2026\u2019 Nobody cared that much, but it got written about. \u2018If they\u2019re going to go in\u2026\u2019 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the statement, because I made it more than any human being alive. \u2018If they\u2019re going into Iraq, keep the oil.\u2019 They never did. They never did.\u201d \u2013 October 27 press conference after the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi   Facts First: We could not find any examples of Trump speaking before the war about keeping Iraq\u2019s oil. (The White House did not respond to a request for evidence.) As with his stance on the invasion itself, Trump appeared to be describing comments he made during the war as if he made them during the run-up to the war.   There was at least slightly more factual basis for this claim than his claim to have opposed the invasion: Trump did have a history of suggesting that the US get or take Middle Eastern countries\u2019 oil. In a CNN appearance in 1987, for example, he called for the US to get a percentage of Kuwait\u2019s oil in exchange for military protection. The same year, Florida\u2019s St. Petersburg Times reported that Trump had suggested in a New Hampshire speech that \u201cthe United States should attack Iran \u2018and take over some of their oil.\u2019 \u201c   But these comments were more than 15 years before the invasion of Iraq, and they were not about Iraq. You can read a longer fact check here.   Trump, his book and Osama bin Laden   \u201cYou know, if you read my book \u2013 there was a book just before the World Trade Center came down. And I don\u2019t get any credit for this, but that\u2019s OK. I never do. But here we are. I wrote a book \u2013 a, really, very successful book. And in that book, about a year before the World Trade Center was blown up, I said, \u2018There is somebody named Osama bin Laden. You better kill him or take him out.\u2019 Something to that effect. \u2018He\u2019s big trouble.\u2019\u201d And: \u201cI think it was about \u2013 if you check, it was about a year before the World Trade Center came down. And I\u2019m saying to people, \u2018Take out Osama bin Laden,\u2019 that nobody ever heard of. Nobody ever heard of\u2026\u201d \u2013 October 27 press conference after the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi   Facts First: Trump\u2019s January 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d mentioned bin Laden once, but it did not call for bin Laden to be killed or warn that he would perpetrate a major attack if he were not killed. In a separate section, the book said the US was in danger of a major terrorist attack that would make the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center look minor in comparison \u2013 but it did not predict that bin Laden or al Qaeda would be the perpetrator of this attack.   You can read a longer fact check here.   The size of China\u2019s economy   \u201cSo, if I weren\u2019t elected, by right now, China would be the largest economy in the world. It was expected. It was said by many people that China would, right now \u2013 they were expecting around the second year of this term.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   \u201cWhen I took office, everybody said that China would be the largest economy in the world within the first two years. And we picked up trillions and trillions of dollars of worth, and China has lost trillions of dollars of worth.\u201d \u2013 October 23 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure   Facts First: Experts on China did not declare that the Chinese economy would be larger than the American economy within two years of Trump taking office, at least not around the time Trump did take office.   \u201cWhen the President took office, there were no predictions China would surpass the US in GDP within two years. Their GDP was 60% the size of the US at the time and slowing. They would have had to grow $7.5 trillion to catch us in two years even if we didn\u2019t grow at all, which would have required 30% annual increases on their part. No one would predict that,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and an expert on the Chinese economy.   Scissors said Trump might possibly have been thinking of three things: bad predictions at the start of the decade that China would pass the US around this time; predictions when Trump came into office that China would pass the US before the end of his hypothetical second term; figures that incorporate purchasing power parity rather than measuring the absolute size of the economies.   China\u2019s economic growth   \u201cWe are much bigger than the China economy. And we\u2019re getting bigger, and they\u2019re not.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: China\u2019s economy is getting bigger, though its growth has slowed. China reported 6% economic growth in the third quarter of 2019 \u2013 the weakest growth since 1992, but growth nonetheless.   China\u2019s official figures are not always reliable, but there is no doubt that China is growing; the International Monetary Fund expects 6.1% growth in 2019 and 5.8% growth in 2020.   Trump\u2019s strike against Syria   \u201cI wiped out the caliphate. And you also saw when I hit 58 rockets, missiles right into the middle. Tomahawk, right into the middle of \u2013 of Syria and knocked out a whole base\u2026\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   Facts First: A Syrian air base did indeed suffer serious damage as a result of the airstrike Trump approved in 2017, but it was not \u201cknocked out.\u201d The Shayrat base had returned to use by the next day, according to the governor of the province of Homs and a UK-based monitoring organization, Reuters reported.   Trump himself acknowledged at the time that the runways had not been destroyed, tweeting: \u201cThe reason you don\u2019t generally hit runways is that they are easy and inexpensive to quickly fix (fill in and top)!\u201d   Hillary Clinton and trade with South Korea   \u201c\u2026 as an example, we finished it with South Korea. What a difference that has made. That was a Hillary Clinton deal. She said, \u2018This will produce 250,000 jobs.\u2019 And she was right, except the jobs were produced for South Korea, not for us, OK?\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: There is no record of Clinton, who served as secretary of state, saying that the US trade deal with South Korea would \u201cproduce 250,000 jobs.\u201d Obama said the deal would \u201csupport at least 70,000 American jobs.\u201d   Clinton was a key figure in the negotiations over the agreement, known as KORUS, but when Trump calls it a \u201cHillary Clinton deal,\u201d it\u2019s worth noting that the agreement was originally signed in 2007 by the George W. Bush administration. The Obama administration renegotiated some of its provisions.   Touting the benefits of his Doral resort in Florida, Trump said, \u201cRight next to the airport, Miami International \u2013one of the biggest airports in the world. Some people say it\u2019s the biggest. But one of the biggest airports in the world.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: Miami International is certainly not the biggest airport in the world.   The airport was not in the top 20 for passenger traffic in 2018 or 2017. It ranked 15th in cargo traffic in 2018 and 14th in 2017, with less than half of the tonnage of cargo of top-ranked Hong Kong.   Though world airports authorities do not release rankings of airports\u2019 physical size, Miami International is not even close to the largest airport in the United States. Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare, for example, occupies about 7,200 acres, Miami International 3,230 acres.   \u201c\u2026you people, with this phony Emoluments Clause\u2026\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: There\u2019s nothing phony about the Constitution\u2019s prohibitions against the President receiving payments from foreign and domestic governments.   The clause on foreign emoluments, found in Article I, Section 9, says that \u201cno person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.\u201d   The clause on domestic emoluments, found in Article II, Section 1, says: \u201cThe President shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.\u201d   Trump might have been attempting to argue that it is phony to apply the clause to his own activities, but, at very least, his wording left an inaccurate impression.   \u201cGeneral Michael Flynn\u2019s attorney is demanding that charges be immediately dropped after they found that FBI Agents manipulated records against him. They say that James Clapper told a reporter to \u2018take a kill shot at Flynn. This has been a complete setup of Michael Flynn. They exonerated him completely of being an agent of Russia (Recently Crooked Hillary charged Tulsi Gabbard & Jill Stein with the same thing-SICK), and yet Mr. Comey still runs to the White House on February 14 and conjures up the Obstruction of Justice narrative against the President when Flynn had been cleared of everything long before that. The DOJ is withholding a lot of evidence & information, as are Clapper & Brennan & all of the people who participated in the complete setup of Michael Flynn.\u2019 (Terrible!) Sidney Powell. This is a disgrace!\u201d \u2013 October 26 tweet   Facts First: We give Trump significant leeway to make minor errors when he is quoting people from television, but he went too far here. Trump attributed to Powell, a lawyer for Flynn, sentences that were actually uttered by Fox & Friends hosts Pete Hegseth and Jedediah Bila. He also added the parenthetical \u201cRecently Crooked Hillary charged Tulsi Gabbard & Jill Stein with the same thing-SICK,\u201d which nobody on the show said.   You can watch the exchange here.   \u201cInterior Secretary \u2013 largest landlord in the United States by a factor of about 200 \u2013 David Bernhardt. Where\u2019s David? David? Thank you, David. Stand up.  What a great job. He\u2019s basically the landlord to about half of the United States.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: We know Trump was speaking informally here, but \u201chalf\u201d is a significant exaggeration. The Congressional Research Service reported in 2017: \u201cThe federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, about 28% of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the United States.\u201d   The land is managed by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture.   \u201cAnd then after the election, The New York Times apologized for their coverage, because they were covering me in such a way. So when I won they actually apologized to their subscribers, because they were losing thousands and thousands of subscribers. The New York Times wrote an apology. Nothing else. You know, they\u2019re saying well, it wasn\u2019t really an apology. It was. Because they covered me so badly.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   Facts First: The Times\u2019 letter was not an apology.   The letter, from publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet, did say the election had raised several questions, including this: \u201cDid Donald Trump\u2019s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?\u201d   But the letter did not issue any apology, to Trump or anyone else.   Here are the claims Trump made last week that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:   The call with Zelensky   Trump said of the phone call: \u201cThere was no anything asked for. There was no pressure whatsoever.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: Trump is free to argue that his requests to Zelensky did not constitute \u201cpressure,\u201d but he is simply wrong that he didn\u2019t make any requests at all. Trump asked Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden, into a debunked conspiracy theory about Democratic computer servers, and to speak with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. In fact, prior to launching into the request about the server, Trump said, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d   You can read a full fact check of this claim here.   The rough transcript   \u201c\u2026 I released a transcription then by stenographers of the exact conversation I had.\u201d  \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   \u201cSo now we have a conversation that\u2019s perfect. And it\u2019s transcribed. And it\u2019s done by totally professional people, stenographers or whatever you would call them. So we have an exact conversation.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   Facts First: The document released by the White House explicitly says, on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of the call.   In testimony on Tuesday, the National Security Council\u2019s top Ukraine expert, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, said that he tried to make edits to the document to include two things that were said on the call but not included in the document, a source told CNN.   The whistleblower\u2019s accuracy   \u201cYou know, these whistleblowers, they have them like they\u2019re angels. OK? So do we have to protect somebody that gave a totally false account of my conversation? I don\u2019t know. You tell me. \u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   \u201cAnd now you don\u2019t hear from the whistleblower anymore, because the whistleblower was talking about this conversation \u2013 in phony terms.\u201d And: \u201cWell, now the funny thing is that they say \u2013 they say that the whistleblower \u2013 they don\u2019t need the whistleblower anymore. Why don\u2019t they need the whistleblower? You know why they don\u2019t need the whistleblower, because the whistleblower\u2019s account of my conversation was totally wrong.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   \u201cWhere is the Whistleblower, and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the Ukrainian President?\u201d \u2013 October 24 tweet   \u201cBut everything was about the Whistleblower (they no longer want the second Whistleblower either), which they don\u2019t want because the account of my call bore NO RELATIONSHIP to the call itself. The entire Impeachment Scam was based on my perfect Ukrainian call, and the Whistleblowers account of that call, which turned out to be false (a fraud?).\u201d \u2013 October 25 tweet   Facts First: The whistleblower\u2019s account of the call has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower\u2019s three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct.   You can read a full fact check here.   Rep. Adam Schiff and the whistleblower   \u201cSo was there actually an informant? Maybe the informant was Schiff. It could be shifty Schiff. In my opinion it\u2019s possibly Schiff.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   \u201cThey don\u2019t like to talk about the \u2013 Adam Schiff said he doesn\u2019t want the whistleblower anymore. You know why? Because he might have given the whistleblower the things to say.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   \u201cWho is the so-called Informant (Schiff?) who was so inaccurate? A giant Scam!\u201d \u2013 October 24 tweet   Facts First: This is nonsensical. Schiff, a Democratic congressman and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, did not have access to the internal White House information the whistleblower revealed; he could not have told the whistleblower about the contents of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky or other information the whistleblower reported. The whistleblower said information about the call came from \u201cmultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\u201d   Schiff did say that it might not be necessary for the whistleblower to testify. He said it might be possible to uncover critical evidence without jeopardizing the whistleblower\u2019s anonymity.   The timing of Schiff\u2019s comments   \u201cSo he made up a lie, and I released \u2013 they never thought that I\u2019d do this \u2013 I released a transcription done by stenographers of the exact conversation I had. And now the game was up.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   \u201cFor instance, when you do a censure vote on Adam Schiff, what did he do? He made up my conversation, totally \u2013 like fiction. It was \u2013 it was fraudulent. He made it sound \u2013 he took that conversation he made it sound \u2013 now, he didn\u2019t know about that conversation. So he went up \u2013 and he made up a phony conversation, read it to Congress, read it the American people. And I released that, and that was the real conversation\u2026\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   \u201cIf you think \u2013 Schiff made up, his words \u2013 not my words. He went before Congress and the American people and he repeated a conversation that I never had, and then I released the conversation, because we had stenographers and transcribers, and the conversation was a perfect conversation.\u201d \u2013 October 25 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group\u2019s Eric Bolling   Facts First: Schiff made his comments about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky the day after Trump released the rough transcript, not before. Before he started claiming that Schiff did not expect a transcript to be released, Trump had complained that Schiff did not read the transcript available to him.   Even Trump\u2019s friendly interviewer here, Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity, seemed to be gently correcting him, noting that the conversation \u201cwas already out\u201d when Schiff spoke.   The legality of Schiff\u2019s comments   \u201cBut he made it sound so horrible. That\u2019s illegal. I mean, it \u2013 no way you can get away with that. That\u2019s a \u2013 but that\u2019s a total fraud.\u201d \u2013 October 25 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group\u2019s Eric Bolling   Facts First: While it\u2019s fair for Trump to be miffed about Schiff\u2019s comments at a congressional committee meeting \u2013 Schiff\u2019s mix of near-quotes from Trump, his own analysis, and supposed \u201cparody\u201d was at the very least confusing \u2013 Schiff\u2019s words were not illegal. The Constitution includes a specific provision that allows members of Congress to speak freely during official meetings.   The whistleblower\u2019s knowledge   \u201cThe whistleblower had second- and third-hand information. You remember that, it was a big problem.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: Some of the whistleblower\u2019s information came from others, but some did not. Michael Atkinson, the Trump-appointed inspector general for the intelligence community, noted that the whistleblower had \u201cdirect knowledge of certain alleged conduct.\u201d   The whistleblower and quid pro quo   \u201cAnd to think they took that call \u2013 now, the big thing I did with that call, Sean, the biggest thing is immediately released it because the whistleblower came out and said horrible things about this call. I think they said there were eight \u2013 seven or eight \u2013 quid pro quos. It was really a terrible call \u2013 you know, all these terrible things about this call.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   Facts First: The whistleblower did not even use the words \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d much less specify a number of times Trump allegedly said them.   People talking about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call   \u201cThe \u2013 one of his (Zelensky\u2019s) top people \u2013 I guess, one of his heads of state came out and said this was a perfect call. There was no pressure. They didn\u2019t even know what we were talking about. To think that they\u2019re using that \u2013 now they don\u2019t talk about that anymore, because that letter was so good. So they don\u2019t talk about it anymore, Sean. And the reason they don\u2019t talk about it: there\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d And: \u201cHow can you take a President \u2013 now, again, they don\u2019t like to talk about the phone call because it was perfect.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   Facts First: To the contrary, Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s President was the subject of widespread discussion among members of Congress and in the media at the time; it was a central focus of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.   The whistleblower being \u201cgone\u201d   \u201cYou never hear, what happened to the whistleblower? They\u2019re gone, because they\u2019ve been discredited.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers say they have firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow \u201cgone,\u201d let alone that they are \u201cgone\u201d because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.   \u201cThe whistleblowers have not vanished,\u201d Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter.   The troops being withdrawn from Syria   \u201cBut when I watch these pundits that always are trying to take a shot, I say \u2013 they say, \u2018What are we getting out of it?\u2019 You know what we\u2019re getting out of it? We\u2019re bringing our soldiers back home. That\u2019s a big thing.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: Trump is not bringing the troops back home, at least not at the moment.   Trump has announced that \u201cUnited States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq,\u201d then that some troops would remain in Syria to protect oil fields. He has also announced that 1,800 more troops would be deployed to Saudi Arabia.   Trump conceded later in the Cabinet meeting that the soldiers will be \u201csent, initially, to different parts,\u201d but he claimed that they would \u201cultimately\u201d return to the US.   The timeline in Syria   \u201cWe won\u2019t be fighting, and we\u2019ll bring our soldiers back home. They were supposed to be there for 30 days, and they\u2019ve been there now for 10 years, in Syria. Ten years.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   \u201cWe want to bring soldiers back home. They were supposed to be there for 30 days. They\u2019re there for 10 years.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   \u201cWe were supposed to be there for 30 days; that was almost 10 years ago. So we\u2019re there for 30 days, and now we\u2019re leaving. It was supposed to be a very quick hit and let\u2019s get out.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech on the situation in Syria   \u201cWe were supposed to be there for 30 days - That was 10 years ago.\u201d \u2013 October 25 tweet   Facts First: There was never any specific timeline for the US military\u2019s involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days. The US began bombing Syria in 2014 and deployed ground troops in 2015 \u2013 five years ago and four years ago, not 10 years ago.   Military spending   \u201cWe are building up America\u2019s military might like never before, investing $2.5 trillion since my election.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech on the situation in Syria   Facts First: Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama\u2019s tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.   Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the \u201c$2.5 trillion\u201d figure \u2013 but the 2020 fiscal year just started on October 1, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.   The deal with Turkey   \u201cPeople have been trying to make this deal for years.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   \u201cThis was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else, no other nation. Very simple. And we\u2019re willing to take blame, and we\u2019re also willing to take credit. This is something they\u2019ve been trying to do for many, many decades.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech on the situation in Syria   Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is baseless to the point of being nonsensical. The deal is a narrow agreement specifically tied to the Turkish offensive that followed Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from a Kurdish-held region of northern Syria, not an agreement that resolves longstanding regional disputes. Further, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush never sought to give Turkey anything like the concessionary terms of Trump\u2019s deal.   You can read a longer fact check here.   The Iraq War   \u201cIf you remember, I didn\u2019t want to go into Iraq. I was a civilian, so I had no power over it. But I always was speaking against going into Iraq.\u201d  \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting.   \u201cIf you read about the history of Donald Trump \u2013 I was a civilian. I had absolutely nothing to do with going into Iraq, and I was totally against it.\u201d And: \u201cIn Iraq \u2013 so they spent \u2013 President Bush went in. I strongly disagreed with it, even though it wasn\u2019t my expertise at the time, but I had a \u2013 I have a very good instinct about things.\u201d \u2013 October 27 press conference after the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi   Facts First: Trump did not publicly oppose the invasion of Iraq before it began. Trump was tentatively supportive of the war when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, \u201cAre you for invading Iraq?\u201d He responded: \u201cYeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d The day after the invasion in March 2003, he said, \u201cIt looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.\u201d Trump did not offer a definitive position on the looming war in a Fox News interview in January 2003, saying, \u201cEither you attack or don\u2019t attack.\u201d   Trump started publicly questioning the war later in 2003, and he was an explicit opponent in 2014. You can read a longer fact check here.   China and nuclear weapons   \u201cRight now we have the most powerful nuclear force in the world. \u2026 And we are discussing with Russia, and we\u2019re discussing with China. During the recent trade deal with China, I said, \u2018We should all get together and work out something \u2013 a cap, have a cap. We don\u2019t need 10,000 weapons, have a cap.\u2019 And I will say China and Russia are talking about it. \u2026 I\u2019m very excited about it. \u2026 And I think Russia would like to make a deal, and I think China would like to make a deal. And I think that\u2019s a big \u2013 that would be a terrific thing. I\u2019d love to be a part of that.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   Facts First: There is no apparent basis for Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cChina would like to make a deal\u201d that would limit its nuclear arsenal. While we can\u2019t know what Chinese officials might have said to Trump in private, China has publicly expressed vehement opposition to negotiating any limits with the US and Russia.   After Trump previously suggested that China wanted to participate in a trilateral deal with the US and Russia, a spokesperson for the Chinese government said in May: \u201cWe oppose any country\u2019s attempt to make an issue out of China on arms control and will not participate in any negotiation for a trilateral nuclear disarmament agreement.\u201d   In October, Bloomberg reported that Fu Cong, director general of the foreign ministry\u2019s Arms Control Department, had said, \u201cChina has no interest in participating in a nuclear-arms-reduction negotiation with the U.S. or Russia, given the huge gap between China\u2019s nuclear arsenal and those of the U.S. and Russia.\u201d   Retired Air Force Col. Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst, told us this week: \u201cChina has developed an expansive overarching military strategy and they don\u2019t believe submitting to a potentially disadvantageous (for them) arms control regime is in China\u2019s best interest. While China did accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, it has never agreed to limits on its short- and intermediate-range missiles. As an ascendant power, China has no real incentive to limit its nuclear arsenal unless it determines that it doesn\u2019t need nuclear weapons to achieve its foreign policy goals.\u201d   Ivanka Trump and jobs   \u201cThrough our Pledge to American Workers, more than 360 companies have committed to providing over 14 million training jobs and career opportunities for the American worker. My daughter, Ivanka, worked so hard on that. That\u2019s her love. It\u2019s her passion. It\u2019s incredible. She came to me at the beginning of the administration, and she said, \u2018I want to help people get jobs, Dad. But they have to be trained.\u2019 She was a great student. She\u2019s a great person. And she said, \u2018But they have to be trained.\u2019 I said, \u2018What\u2019s your goal?\u2019 She said, \u2019500,000 jobs.\u2019 She just hit 14 million. Can you be \u2013 I said, \u2018That\u2019s Ivanka.\u2019 You know, that\u2019s Ivanka. Fourteen million jobs.\u201d \u2013 October 25 speech to 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum   Facts First: Given that fewer than 6.5 million jobs had been created during the entire Trump presidency through September, Ivanka Trump, the President\u2019s daughter and White House adviser, was obviously not responsible for \u201c14 million jobs.\u201d As Trump alluded to in a slightly more accurate remark earlier in this paragraph, companies have promised to create more than 14 million \u201cnew opportunities\u201d for workers as of Wednesday \u2013 but many of these \u201copportunities\u201d are internal training opportunities, not new jobs.   The web page for the pledge program describes them as \u201ceducation and training opportunities.\u201d Also, as CNN has previously reported, many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative.   The Cameron LNG plant in Louisiana   \u201cThink what that \u2013 I just left Louisiana recently. And we opened a $10 billion LNG plant. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen a longer building. It\u2019s like a skyscraper laid on its side. It is the most incredible thing you\u2019ve ever seen. More pipes in that building that \u2013 nobody realized how complex it is. But it took years and years, and it was a dead project. And I had it approved almost immediately.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: The permits for the Sempra Energy facility Trump visited in May were granted by the Obama administration.   The company says on its website: \u201cThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorized the project in June 2014.\u201d The company confirmed to FactCheck.org: \u201cYou are correct, Cameron LNG was approved in 2014.\u201d The facility made its first shipment in late May.   Energy independence   \u201cSince I came in we\u2019re now energy independent.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   \u201cWe\u2019re now energy independent. Who would\u2019ve thought that? That wasn\u2019t going to happen for a long time.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: While definitions of \u201cenergy independence\u201d vary, the US is not \u201cenergy independent\u201d by any definition; it is expected to export more energy than it imports by 2020, according to the government\u2019s Energy Information Administration, but that has not happened yet. In the first five months of 2019, PolitiFact noted, the US also consumed more energy than it produced. There have been occasional, brief periods where US exports have exceed imports or where its production has exceeded consumption, but this hasn\u2019t happened for a full recent year.   You can read a longer fact check here.   The unemployment rate   \u201cUnemployment is at the lowest rate in more than 51 years.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: This was one of Trump\u2019s signature little exaggerations. The September rate, 3.5%, was the lowest since December 1969, just under 50 years ago.   Unemployment for women   Trump said women have their lowest unemployment numbers in \u201c71 years.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: This was another exaggeration. It has been 66 years since the women\u2019s rate has been as low as it was in September, 3.4%, not 71 years.   Prescription drug prices   \u201cAnd we had the first year ever where prices actually went down.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs showed a 0.6% decline between December 2017 and December 2018, which was the first calendar-year decline since 1972, not the first one \u201cever.\u201d (As The Washington Post pointed out in its own fact check, some experts say the Consumer Price Index is a flawed measure of trends in drug prices, since it doesn\u2019t include rebates that drug companies pay to insurers. The IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, which studies drug prices, found that \u201cnet drug prices in the United States increased at an estimated 1.5% in 2018.\u201d)   China\u2019s economic performance   \u201cChina is doing very poorly. Worst year they\u2019ve had in 57 years. I wonder why. I wonder why. I\u2019m sure you can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d  \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   \u201cAll over the world \u2013 countries aren\u2019t doing well. China\u2019s not doing well. China\u2019s having the worst year they\u2019ve had in 57 years.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   Facts First: China\u2019s second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992, 27 years ago.   Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.   China\u2019s agricultural purchases   \u201cWell, one little example is the farmers. So they were told and I was told, if we could get $20 billion a year in purchase \u2013 the biggest they\u2019ve ever done is $16 (billion), is what I\u2019ve heard and what they\u2019ve said. If we could get $20 billion a year from China \u2013 that China purchases $20 billion a year of agricultural product \u2013 that would be a great thing.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: China spent $25.9 billion on American agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture.   Who is paying for the tariffs on China   \u201cAnd we\u2019re doing great. We\u2019re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China, and they\u2019re eating the tariffs because they devalued their currency.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   \u201cDon\u2019t forget China\u2019s paying us tens of billions of dollars in tariffs, and it\u2019s had a huge impact on China. And it hasn\u2019t cost us anything because they devalued their currency or they\u2019ve poured money in. It hasn\u2019t cost us \u2013 they\u2019ve eaten that. They\u2019ve eaten it totally.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   Facts First: A bevy of economic studies have found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.   The USMCA and Canada   \u201cWe need \u2013 for our farmers, our manufacturers, for, frankly, unions and non-unions, we need USMCA to be voted on. If it\u2019s voted on, it\u2019ll pass. It\u2019s up to Nancy Pelosi to put it up. \u2026 Mexico and Canada have approved it; it\u2019s done. They\u2019re waiting for our approval. And we can\u2019t seem to get the votes.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   \u201c\u2026and all the things we\u2019ve done, and we have to get USMCA done, and they don\u2019t want to put it up for a vote. And the Do-Nothing Democrats, they will pass it, but it has to be put up Nancy Pelosi. \u2026 It\u2019s approved by Mexico. It\u2019s approved by Canada. It\u2019s approved by everybody that has to be approved. We have to give it a vote. It\u2019s been sitting for a long time.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: Mexico\u2019s Senate has voted to approve the USMCA trade agreement, but Canada\u2019s Parliament has not. (The agreement is highly unlikely to be rejected by Parliament, but still, the voting has not happened yet.)   The crowd in Dallas, part 1   \u201cI was in Dallas the other night, we set a record in a stadium \u2013 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s got to be an arena that\u2019s got to be 20 years old \u2026 we have a record.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   \u201cI go to these massive basketball arenas, like in Dallas, where the Mavericks play, and fill it up and set a record.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: Trump did not break the attendance record at the American Airlines Center. Jason Evans, a spokesman for the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department, told CNN that the fire department and the arena calculated an attendance of 18,500. The Dallas Mavericks, who play in the arena, had an average announced attendance of 20,013 per game last season, among the highest in the NBA, according to ESPN data.   The crowd in Dallas, part 2   Trump said of his rally the previous week in Dallas: \u201cI had 25,000 people, close, in that arena.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: Again, the Dalas Fire-Rescue Department put the number at 18,500.   Trump said of the Dallas rally: \u201cAnd we had 20,000 people outside, at least.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: Trump\u2019s estimate was way off, though it was lower than the \u201cclose to 30,000\u201d he had claimed during the speech. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have 30K outside. Probably had upward of 5K outside,\u201d Dallas Police Department spokesman Sgt. Mitchell Warren told CNN in response to that previous Trump estimate.   Rally crowds in general   \u201cI haven\u2019t had an empty seat at a rally.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including a rally earlier this month in Minneapolis, a July rally in Greenville, North Carolina, an October 2018 rally in Houston and an April 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.   \u201cI love the Republicans. Ninety-four and 95% approval rating they gave me recently.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   Facts First: Trump\u2019s approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find.   Trump was at 90% with Republicans in a CNN poll conducted from October 17-20, 83% with Republicans in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted from October 17-21, 81% in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted October 18-22.   \u201cLook at North Carolina. Great state. Great people. Two races that were going to be lost, I went in, made a speech, let everybody know I really respect these two guys and they\u2019re going to be great, they both won. They both won by good margins.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   \u201cYou saw what happened in North Carolina: We picked up two seats that people didn\u2019t think we were going to pick up. That was two weeks ago.\u201d  \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting   Facts First: The special elections in North Carolina were six weeks ago, not two weeks ago. While the race in the 9th District was considered competitive, the race in the 3rd District was expected by pollsters and analysts to be won easily by the Republican candidate.   Both seats had previously been held by Republicans, so the party did not pick them up. (Trump might have just been speaking informally.)   \u201cLook, I think that the Democrats are not good politicians. I think they have lousy policy. They have policy of open borders and sanctuary cities and crime.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   \u201cTheir policies are horrible: open borders, sanctuary cities, take everyone\u2019s guns away.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference   \u201cLOUISIANA! Extreme Democrat John Bel Edwards has sided with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to support Sanctuary Cities, High Taxes, and Open Borders.\u201d \u2013 October 26 tweet   Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.   \u201cThe Fake Washington Post keeps doing phony stories, with zero sources, that I am concerned with the Impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong.\u201d \u2013 October 26 tweet.   Facts First: There is simply no evidence that the Post fabricated its sources for this article. Trump is entitled to argue that the sources aren\u2019t correct, but there is no basis for the claim that the sources don\u2019t exist.   The article began: \u201cAfter weeks of dismissing the impeachment inquiry as a hollow partisan attack, President Trump and his closest advisers now recognize that the snowballing probe poses a serious threat to the president \u2013 and that they have little power to block it, according to multiple aides and advisers.\u201d   \u201cIt ended with a very poor performance (by Robert Mueller, testifying to Congress). And this is after more than two years of an investigation where they spent $45 million or something like that.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity   \u201cI fought off the Mueller hoax. I fought off all of them, and it continues. It\u2019s just crazy. This has never happened to a president before, and they spend $45 million. \u2026 I could find something on you for $45 million, and you\u2019re perfect.\u201d \u2013 October 25 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group\u2019s Eric Bolling   \u201cThis is a hoax \u2013 just like there was no collusion. After two years, they found out and wasted $45 million. This is a disgrace that this could happen in our country.\u201d \u2013 October 25 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure   \u201cSpent $45 million, and they found nothing.\u201d \u2013 October 25 speech to 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum   Facts First: The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $45 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department, and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.   The vast majority of this $17 million is expected to come from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was ordered to forfeit assets and pay millions to the Internal Revenue Service.   CNN\u2019s Aaron Kessler contributed to this article.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans \u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network.", "Fact-checking Republican complaints on impeachment | CNN Politics": " Since House Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump last month, Congressional Republicans have attempted to push back on everything from the basis for the inquiry to the process itself. A handful of Republicans have been increasingly vocal about what they say has been an unfair, secretive process. This week, those GOP grumblings turned into action.   On Wednesday, approximately two dozen House Republicans, led by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, crashed a secure room in Congress where a closed hearing was underway as part of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into the President.  According to CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, some of the conservatives entered the room yelling and calling the process a sham.   A committee official told CNN that the House Republicans violated House deposition rules by entering the secure room, known as the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. They also criticized the Republican members for bringing in their phones and other electronics, which goes against the rules of a SCIF and opens up the classified topics discussed wherein to tap-able recording devices.   Adding to the chorus of complaints, South Carolina Rep. Sen. Lindsey Graham on Thursday called the impeachment proceedings in the House \u201cunfair and dangerous.\u201d   Crashing hearings is not unprecedented. In fact, Gaetz himself has been refused entry to impeachment hearings before, since he is not a member of any of the committees conducting the inquiry. But this latest attempt violated procedural rules and caused a major security breach to protest a difference in opinion over the proper process for impeachment.   Related article Republicans' circus\u00a0strategy\u00a0on impeachment   However, formal impeachment proceedings are rare, so the process is based predominantly on precedent, rather than steadfast rules. According to the Congressional Research Service, \u201cShould a simple majority of the House approve articles of impeachment specifying the grounds upon which the impeachment is based, the matter is then presented to the Senate, to which the Constitution provides the sole power to try an impeachment.\u201d   Contrary to the complaints, the impeachment proceedings have not been entirely irregular. Here are some facts and context behind the Republicans\u2019 complaints.   One aspect of the House\u2019s current proceedings that Republican leaders have criticized is the lack of a full House vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry. In a letter, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said continuing the inquiry without a vote would render the process \u201cdevoid of any merit or legitimacy.\u201d   While the House voted to launch a formal impeachment inquiry in the case of both Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Democrats say the Constitution does not require any such vote to conduct an inquiry. Furthermore, recent changes to subpoena powers mean the Democratic-majority House committees leading the inquiry already have that tool at their disposal.   Rep. Jim Jordan criticized the secretive nature of the hearings, telling Fox News\u2019s Bill Hemmer and Sandra Smith that \u201cit\u2019s all being done in the basement of the Capitol where no one in the country can see.\u201d   The hearings are taking place in the SCIF, a secure space on Capitol Hill often used for classified briefings, which is located in the basement of the Congressional Visitor\u2019s Center. The SCIF is where the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 which is leading the impeachment investigation \u2014 conducts its work. It\u2019s the same space where the Republican-led Intelligence Committee conducted interviews for the Russia investigation in the last Congress.   Although normally committee hearings must be open, members can vote to close the hearing under specific circumstances. According to House rules, a hearing should be closed if the \u201cdisclosure\u201d of the witnesses would defame or incriminate someone, endanger national security, compromise sensitive law enforcement info, or violate a House rule.   Investigations into Nixon and Clinton also both featured closed door depositions before public hearings. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said the committees will hold public hearings after the initial round of closed-door interviews.   Schiff told reporters it was important the hearings were closed so as to prevent witnesses from overhearing and influencing each others\u2019 testimony, similar to the rationale used in criminal investigations.   President Trump has also criticized the Democrats\u2019 impeachment hearings for \u201cselective leaks,\u201d writing on Twitter that they were \u201callowing no transparency.\u201d   It\u2019s not true that there has been \u201cno transparency.\u201d The names of scheduled and subpoenaed witnesses are public. Additionally, the opening statements of several witnesses have been made available after their testimony.   Schiff has said he plans to release transcripts but has not specified when.   However, it is true that some information has been leaked, but both Republicans and Democrats have a long history of leaking information when convenient, as well as ridiculing leakers when the info is inconvenient. And some of the leaks, such as opening statements, have come from the witnesses themselves, including one that was issued as a press release.   On Fox, Jordan claimed, \u201cIn the interviews, no White House lawyers can be there, no agency lawyers can be there.\u201d   It\u2019s true that White House lawyers are not participating, but barring them is not surprising nor unusual for hearings of this nature.   To justify his decision, Schiff has said he is conducting these preliminary hearings like grand jury testimony.  And Republicans will have their chance to allow White House lawyers to participate should the impeachment inquiry go to trial in the Senate.   However, to Jordan\u2019s point, for the closed-door sessions during the Nixon impeachment investigation, the President\u2019s lawyer was allowed to participate and cross-examine witnesses.   On October 16, McCarthy accused the Democrats of preventing Republicans from cross-examining witnesses during these hearings.   Schiff said this is inaccurate, and that he has been conscientious about \u201cgiving the GOP members every opportunity to ask questions.\u201d   McCarthy\u2019s fellow Republican Rep. Mark Meadows told The Washington Post that each side alternates asking questions in set time blocks and that there has been no limit provided for the number of questions each side can ask the witnesses.   Normal procedure dictates that the chair of the committee gets the first statement, then the ranking member or another member of the minority, followed by the witnesses opening statement.   Thus far, staff attorneys for both parties have led the majority of the questioning, with members adding in their own questions, too. Lawmakers and aides have told CNN the Democrats and Republicans have traded off hourlong and 45-minute rounds until all of their questions have been exhausted, meaning both sides have equal time.   Jordan told Fox News the Republicans \u201ccan\u2019t get the witnesses we want to call.\u201d   This is because the House Republicans are in the minority and as such, they do not have subpoena power.   In both the Nixon and Clinton impeachment inquiries, language in the resolution granted the minority party this power, but with a caveat: subpoenas were voted upon by the committee, which meant the majority, in theory, had the power to block subpoenas proposed by the minority.   Even in the Clinton investigation, witnesses for the defense were not called until several weeks of hearings had already been completed.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

CNN\u2019s KFile identified that the photo with Trump and Lev Parnas was apparently taken at a fashion show at the Cadillac Championship, an annual professional golf tournament. The fashion show was for the luxury fashion brand Carolina Herrera on March 7 and was also attended by Trump\u2019s sons Eric and Donald Jr. and Ivanka\u2019s husband Jared Kushner, who is now a senior White House adviser along with his wife. Donald Trump spoke at the event, according to photos and a video posted on YouTube.   Parnas, along with his associate Igor Fruman, were arrested last week trying to leave the country and indicted on criminal charges for allegedly funneling foreign money into US elections. The two men are associates of Giuliani, an attorney for the President, and are connected to efforts to dig up dirt in Ukraine on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.   The photo of Parnas and Trump was first reported by Politico on Saturday, but the outlet did not report on the circumstances surrounding it. An additional photo of the crowd from the event, found by CNN\u2019s KFile, shows Parnas mingling in the crowd. CNN\u2019s KFile identified the event by matching pictures posted online by various photographers and attendees with the date of the event.   Parnas\u2019 attendance at a Trump event in 2014 raises questions about whether he had any existing relationship with the President. Trump said last week he didn\u2019t know Parnas or Fruman.   \u201cI don\u2019t know those gentlemen. Now it\u2019s possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody, I have a picture with everybody here,\u201d Trump said.   The photo of Trump and Parnas smiling side-by-side was posted on Facebook on March 8, 2014, by user Shawn Jaros, who indicated in subsequent posts that he was a business associate of Parnas. Jaros declined to comment on the photo, as did John Dowd, a lawyer for Parnas.   A reception took place following the event that was open to ticket holders for the tournament that day, with VIP options available for luxury ticket holders.   A Getty Images photo of the crowd at the event shows Parnas standing in the crowd in the same bright blue shirt with a gray collar he wore in his photo with Trump. A small set of tables similar to those where Trump sat with his children near the stage can be seen off to the side. In one picture, posted on Facebook, Trump and his son Eric can be seen chatting with a guest.   Representatives for the Trump Organization did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the event. A White House spokesperson for Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump declined to comment.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

But journalists were reporting the position he and his top officials had repeatedly expressed over the previous 14 months.   Facts First: Trump said in June 2019 and in July 2018 that he would meet with Iran with \u201cno pre-conditions.\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin both said the same \u2013 five days before this tweet.   Trump has a history of accusing media outlets of \u201cfake news\u201d for reports that are accurate.   Here\u2019s a timeline of instances in which Trump and senior administration officials said he was willing to meet with Iran with no pre-conditions:   July 30, 2018: During a press conference with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Trump said of Iran, \u201cI do believe that they will probably end up wanting to meet, and I\u2019m ready to meet any time they want to.\u201d Asked if he would have pre-conditions for a meeting, Trump said, \u201cNo pre-conditions.

If they want to meet, I\u2019ll meet.\u201d   July 31, 2018: White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley was asked, \u201cIs the President still willing to meet with the Iranian leader, no pre-conditions?\u201d Gidley said, \u201cThat\u2019s not changed. But he\u2019s been clear on what he wants from Iran, and that is to end its destabilization efforts, its actions of being the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror.\u201d   June 2, 2019: Pompeo said at a press conference in Switzerland: \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to engage in a conversation with no pre-conditions.

Monica Crowley, who was appointed by Trump last week as assistant treasury secretary for public affairs, made multiple comments spreading these false claims on her personal blog and in at least one tweet between 2009 and 2015, according to a review by CNN\u2019s KFile team.   Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an \u201cIslamic community organizer\u201d trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama\u2019s birth certificate were \u201clegitimate concerns.\u201d During Obama\u2019s presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama\u2019s birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama\u2019s origins.   Related article Conservative commentator Monica Crowley in talks to join Treasury   Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN\u2019s KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.   Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.   Writing on her blog in August 2010, Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.   Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.   \u201cMaybe politics didn\u2019t have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate,\u201d wrote Crowley. \u201cHe grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has \u201957\u2019 states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57.\u201d   \u201cIt may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?\u201d she added.   Crowley added, \u201cHow could he\u2026.support the enemy?\u201d   Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama\u2019s long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama\u2019s citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.   \u201cIf the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,\u201d wrote Crowley.   \u201cFor over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama\u2019s origins and background,\u201d she added. \u201cHe was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family\u2019s religious background, his parents\u2019 political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst.\u201d   In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama\u2019s request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.   Writing about the Obama administration in June 2013, Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.   \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I\u2019m sure you can figure that one out,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat it says about America\u2019s national security is that it looks increasingly like it\u2019s being dictated BY that sworn enemy.\u201d   Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president\u2019s sympathies.   \u201cBarack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,\u201d she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. \u201cThe two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.   \u201cNow comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya,\u201d she added. \u201cTells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d   In February 2015, Crowley shared what she called an \u201cimportant column,\u201d with the title \u201cObama\u2019s Two Faces of Islam.\u201d The column, written by author Bill Siegel and still available on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, argues that Obama is an \u201cIslamic community organizer\u201d and is \u201cconforming US policy to Islam and Sharia.\u201d   \u201cThe administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia,\u201d reads the column.   \u201cObama\u2019s actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy \u201ccompanions\u201d dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US\u2019s best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

So we looked more closely and came away with two big findings. First, Ocasio-Cortez and her \u201cSquad\u201d mate Ilhan Omar have been talked about a lot more on Fox than on other cable news channels this year. Second, the freshmen have been getting more attention on cable than seasoned leaders of the Democratic Party.   Trump\u2019s week-long criticism of the \u201cThe Squad,\u201d including his \u201cgo back\u201d tweet, has intensified these dynamics.   But it has been true all year long: Ocasio-Cortez has been mentioned on Fox almost three times as often as she\u2019s been mentioned on CNN or MSNBC. This has fueled the perception, particularly on the right, that her positions and policies are representative of the Democratic Party as a whole.   On Sunday, Trump tweeted, \u201cI don\u2019t believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify what he believes makes them incapable. But his tweet provoked even more discussion of the subject.   Related article Media react to 'send her back' chant at Trump rally   And a new poll indicates that the right\u2019s criticism of the women has had palpable effects. CBS News, citing the results of a new survey conducted by YouGov, reported on Sunday that Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, along with fellow congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, \u201care better known to Republicans than they are to members of their own party, and as with many members of Congress, many Americans are unfamiliar with them.\u201d   Right-wing media coverage is just one cause of this effect, to be sure.   But it is striking to discover just how much airtime the Democratic lawmakers have garnered \u2014 especially from some of their harshest critics.   Tucker Carlson, for example, has called Ocasio-Cortez a \u201cmoron\u201d and asserted that immigrants like Omar, who was born in Somalia, are \u201cdangerous.\u201d   His prime-time show frequently promotes claims that \u201cradical Dems are destroying the party,\u201d to quote one recent on-screen banner.   Last week, Carlson said \u201cit\u2019s pretty obvious\u201d that the freshman congresswomen \u201care becoming, with the help of CNN and MSNBC, the face of the Democratic Party.\u201d   Carlson\u2019s guest, Richard Goodstein, a lawyer and Democratic political consultant, challenged that. He pointed out that Fox News \u201cdoes a pretty nice job of elevating her.\u201d Carlson conceded the point but said \u201cit\u2019s not just Fox promoting these people.\u201d   The data backs up Goodstein\u2019s observation.   Between January 3 and July 20, Ocasio-Cortez has been mentioned at least 1,325 times on Fox News, according to data from the Internet Archive\u2019s database of television news closed captioning text.   The database ingests all of the words that are uttered on a variety of TV sources, including cable news channels.   The data is incomplete because it does not include nicknames, like AOC, or other shorthand references to the names of individuals. But it provides a rough yardstick for how much airtime and attention is spent on various topics.   During the same time period, Ocasio-Cortez was mentioned at least 465 times on MSNBC and 464 times on CNN.   Omar\u2019s name has been invoked at least 405 times on Fox this year, compared with 230 times on CNN and 177 times on MSNBC.   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 who wields far more power than any individual congresswoman \u2014 has been mentioned at least 2,418 times on Fox, 2,068 times on MSNBC, and 1,957 times on CNN.   Related article Murrow's words from 1954 apply to the Trump age: 'We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty'   There are logical reasons why freshmen congresswomen, representing an insurgent wing of the party, have been getting an outsized amount of attention.   But the attention has been coming from Fox News at a far greater level than CNN or MSNBC.   For comparison\u2019s sake, Democrat James Clyburn, a key member of House leadership, has been mentioned far less than Omar or Ocasio-Cortez. The closed captioning database found at least 63 mentions of Clyburn on Fox, 81 on MSNBC, and 57 on CNN.   The CBS poll asked about Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley and Tlaib in the midst of Trump\u2019s rhetorical attacks.   The finding: \u201cAll have net favorable ratings among Democrats who do know them \u2014 particularly among Democrats who are liberal \u2014 and dramatically unfavorable ratings among Republicans,\u201d CBS reported. \u201cThat adds up to their having net unfavorable views among the public as a whole, and in this, they are similar to more established leaders of both parties,\u201d like House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell.

In a 2000 column, Moore complained about his wife voting for Democrats, writing, \u201cWomen are sooo malleable! No wonder there\u2019s a gender gap.\u201d In another column in 2000, Moore criticized female athletes advocating for pay equality, writing that they wanted \u201cequal pay for inferior work.\u201d   Moore, who subsequently worked as a Wall Street Journal editorial board member, was at the time the president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political organization. He was a CNN contributor from 2017 until last month.   Moore told CNN\u2019s KFile in an email, \u201cThis was a spoof.  I have a sense of humor.\u201d   The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Related article Stephen Moore once slammed Trump's 'dangerous' immigration position, Larry Kudlow compared it to worst parts of World War II   The columns are attracting renewed attention as his prior views and statements face scrutiny ahead of what could be a contentious confirmation process to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Trump said in March he intends to nominate Moore to the position, but Moore has not officially been nominated yet.   The resurfaced comments come as Trump tweeted Monday that his other pick for a seat on Fed board, Herman Cain, had withdrawn from consideration amid renewed scrutiny over allegations of sexual harassment that ended his 2012 presidential campaign. Cain has denied the allegations and repeatedly said he had no plans to remove himself from consideration, but he had no clear path for Senate approval after four Republican senators announced that they would not vote for him.   In one of his 2002 columns, Moore suggested changes to March Madness tournament to get rid of \u201cun-American\u201d aspects of it. The first rule proposed by Moore was \u201cno women.\u201d   \u201cHere\u2019s the rule change I propose: No more women refs, no women announcers, no women beer venders, no women anything,\u201d he wrote in March 2002. \u201cThere is, of course, an exception to this rule. Women are permitted to participate, if and only if, they look like Bonnie Bernstein. The fact that Bonnie knows nothing about basketball is entirely irrelevant.\u201d He later wrote that Bernstein, a CBS sports journalist at the time, should wear halter tops.   Earlier the column, Moore expressed disgust at a woman refereeing an NCAA game.   \u201cHow outrageous is this? This year they allowed a woman ref a men\u2019s NCAA game. Liberals celebrate this breakthrough as a triumph for gender equity,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cThe NCAA has been touting this as example of how progressive they are. I see it as an obscenity. Is there no area in life where men can take vacation from women? What\u2019s next? Women invited to bachelor parties? Women in combat? (Oh yeah, they\u2019ve done that already.) Why can\u2019t women ref he women\u2019s games and men the men\u2019s games. I can\u2019t wait to see the first lady ref have a run in with Bobby Knight.\u201d   Related article Four Republican senators say they'd vote 'no' on Cain   Moore wrote that this was part of the \u201cbigger and more serious social problem in America\u201d which was  \u201cthe feminization of basketball generally.\u201d Moore added he didn\u2019t care about watching women\u2019s basketball and he was upset games were shown on ESPN.   \u201cAnd while I\u2019m venting on the subject, here\u2019s another travesty: in playground games and rec leagues these days, women now feel free to play with the men \u2014 uninvited in almost every case,\u201d added Moore. \u201cThere\u2019s no joy in dunking over a girl. Never mind that I can\u2019t dunk (except on the eight-foot baskets). If I could, I wouldn\u2019t celebrate dunking over someone named Tina.\u201d   Moore addressed complaints about his column the 13 days later, mocking claims of sexism.   \u201cSeveral readers (all women) have called and e-mailed complaining about my last column as \u2018sexist\u2019 because I said that women shouldn\u2019t be permitted to ref the men\u2019s game,\u201d wrote Moore. \u201cTheir retort was: \u2018Well then why should men ref the women\u2019s games?\u2019 Look, for all I care the women can use chimpanzees to ref their games. I hate women\u2019s basketball.\u201d   In another column in 2003, Moore again wrote there should be \u201cno women announcers.\u201d And in 2001, Moore wrote, \u201cAnother problem is that CBS now has women announcers and commentators. Is nothing sacred?\u201d   Writing in another column in 2000, Moore said the real issue of inequality in sports was women making more than \u201ccollegiate level\u201d men who Moore said \u201ccould beat them handily.\u201d   \u201cThe women tennis pros don\u2019t really want equal pay for equal work. They want equal pay for inferior work. There\u2019s a very practical reason why Pete Sampras, for example, makes a lot more money than Martina Hingis does,\u201d wrote Moore. \u201cHe\u2019s much, much better than she is. The day that Martina can return Pete\u2019s serve is the day she should get paid what he does. If there is an injustice in tennis, it\u2019s that women like Martina Hingis and Monica Seles make millions of dollars a year, even though there are hundreds of men at the collegiate level (assuming their schools haven\u2019t dropped the sport) who could beat them handily.\u201d   \u201cYet these men make nothing.

Sirota, who is known for both his reporting and combative Twitter presence, had been informally advising the campaign on a trial basis since the day after Sanders formally launched his 2020 bid for the presidency last month. But shortly before his hiring was announced, Sirota began erasing old tweets, many of which ran contrary to Sanders\u2019 call last month for supporters and surrogates to adopt a more friendly tone in their public exchanges with political rivals.   According to campaign manager Faiz Shakir, Sirota began the trial arrangement, in which he would assist Sanders with speechwriting, on Feb. 20, a day after Sanders made his candidacy official. Sirota left his post with the Capital and Main website on Feb. 14, Shakir said. He then signed a formal letter to become the campaign speechwriter on March 11. The trial period was to see how Sanders, who traditionally prefers to handwrite his own speeches on yellow-lined paper, would work with a speechwriter.   Sirota did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on his new role with the Sanders campaign.   Sirota\u2019s last byline for Capital and Main was on Feb. 6, an interview with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who has since announced his own candidacy. In a statement posted on Twitter, Guardian editor John Mulholland, said Sirota was last published in the newspaper in December, and that Sirota\u2019s first contact with the Sanders campaign did not come until mid-January.   Despite ending his work as a journalist, Sirota still presented himself as such well past the time he began informally advising Sanders. Screen captures from his Twitter account from Feb. 21 show that he described himself as a \u201c@CapitalandMain and @GuardianUS journo.\u201d   During that trial run advising the campaign, Sirota traveled with a large contingent of the Sanders team to Chicago from New York for the second rally of the campaign\u2019s launch weekend.   A review of Sirota\u2019s tweets \u2013 captured through the nonprofit Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine \u2013 from Feb 20 through this morning shows that Sirota never disclosed his ties to Sanders, but regularly promoted the senator and his campaign. In addition to making critical remarks about President Donald Trump \u2013 who would be Sanders\u2019 opponent in the general election \u2013 Sirota attacked other 2020 candidates, including former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and potential third-party hopeful ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Shultz.   He also criticized several other politicians, both Republican and Democrat, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and both Colorado Sens. Michael Bennet, another potential Democratic presidential candidate, and Cory Gardner, a Republican. Additionally, Sirota was critical of a Boston Globe columnist\u2019s coverage of the Sanders launch.   Sirota has a long history of regularly challenging politicians, including many of Sanders\u2019 primary opponents. As late as December, he wrote several stories that appeared in the Guardian that were critical of the record of former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, now another 2020 Democratic contender. He also regularly attacked many of the Democratic primary field on Twitter.   For example, he was highly critical of Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and his launch for president, writing on Feb. 1, before he started advising Sanders, \u201cI watched @CoryBooker\u2019s \u2018we will rise\u2019 video & then remembered that Cory Booker defended Mitt Romney\u2019s Wall St firm, attacked the Obama \u2026\u201d   As of Tuesday morning, Sirota had scrubbed his Twitter page of some 20,000 tweets going back several years. The campaign would not say whether it asked Sirota to delete his old tweets.   The Sirota hire comes alongside a campaign pledge by the Sanders team to run a respectful campaign. Shortly after Sanders announced, the campaign sent their surrogates a letter, from Sanders himself, asking them to not personally attack his opponents.   \u201cAs we engage with our opponents in the Democratic primary, we will forcefully present our views and defend ourselves against misrepresentations. But, let us do our very best to engage respectfully with our Democratic opponents \u2013 talking about the issues we are fighting for, not about personalities or past grievances,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cI want to be clear that I condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space.   In addition to his attacks in the current cycle, Sirota was also a regular critic of Hillary Clinton and her campaign in 2016. He often hammered reporters covering the Clinton campaign, faulting them for not being critical enough of the former secretary of state.   The campaign also hired Briahna Joy Gray, formerly a writer and reporter for outlets such as the Intercept, as national press secretary for Sanders\u2019 campaign. Gray has also been fiercely critical of Democrats.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

McDonagh said he found the account suspicious due to its \u201chigh follower count, highly polarized and yet inconsistent political messaging, the unusually high rate of tweets, and the use of someone else\u2019s image in the profile photo.\u201d   Molly McKew, an information warfare researcher who saw the tweet and shared it herself on Saturday, said she later realized that a network of anonymous accounts were working to amplify the video.   Speaking about the nature of fake accounts on social media, McKew told CNN Business, \u201cThis is the new landscape: where bad actors monitor us and appropriate content that fits their needs. They know how to get it where they need to go so it amplifies naturally. And at this point, we are all conditioned to react and engage or deny in specific ways. And we all did.\u201d   Related article Opinion: The tricky lesson of MAGA hat confrontation   Twitter\u2019s rules forbid users from creating \u201cfake and misleading accounts,\u201d and shortly after CNN Business asked Twitter about the account, it was suspended.   A spokesperson for Twitter told CNN Business, \u201cDeliberate attempts to manipulate the public conversation on Twitter by using misleading account information is a violation of the Twitter Rules.\u201d   The source familiar with Twitter\u2019s investigation told CNN Business the company\u2019s initial findings suggested the account was run from the US, but said it can be difficult to determine an account owner\u2019s actual location.   Twitter users can try to mask their true location using services like virtual private networks,\u00a0which can\u00a0allow users to appear\u00a0as if they are in a different country.   CNN Business has not\u00a0independently\u00a0determined where this account was being run from.   CNN Business was unable to reach the person, or people, behind the account, to ask if they were indeed a California schoolteacher that chose to use someone else\u2019s picture. Soon after we pointed out on Twitter that the account was using a different woman\u2019s profile picture, the account blocked this reporter.  Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Kirsten Gillibrand entering the 2020 presidential race on Tuesday, her dramatic shift on the issue of immigration over the past decade will likely be one of the central questions about her candidacy as she seeks to take on President Donald Trump.   Gillibrand, as a congresswoman for a little more than two years from a mostly white and more conservative district in upstate New York, opposed \u201camnesty for illegal immigrants\u201d and voted to increase funding for US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to work with local law enforcement on deportations. As the junior senator from New York, Gillibrand now espouses much more liberal positions on the issue, and last year called for the abolishment and reimagining of ICE.   A review by CNN\u2019s KFile of Gillibrand\u2019s old campaign websites and materials, speeches, interviews and legislative history show how central Gillibrand\u2019s conservative positions on immigration were to her message during her brief career as a member of the House.   Running for the House in 2006, Gillibrand attacked her opponent from the right on immigration and called securing the border \u201ca national security priority.\u201d In a 2007 interview, Gillibrand said \u201cyou have to close the borders\u201d as a first step to \u201cright size\u201d immigration. In a 2008 mailer sent from her congressional office, Gillibrand touted her efforts to expedite \u201cthe removal of illegal aliens by expanding detention capacity and increasing the number of Federal District Court judges.\u201d   Related article Kirsten Gillibrand enters 2020 presidential race   Those positions could complicate her ability to effectively challenge Trump, who has taken similar positions and has made his opposition to illegal immigration central to his political message.   Gillibrand has called aspects of her record in the House from 2007 through early 2009 something she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d and \u201cashamed\u201d of, and she\u2019s said her change on the issue has come from understanding the perspective of undocumented immigrants living in fear of the deportation of a family member.   \u201cI think it is important to know when you are wrong and to do what is right, and I will do what is right and I will fight for what is right and I don\u2019t back down from those fights,\u201d Gillibrand told reporters Wednesday when asked about her shifts on issues like immigration.   But the timing of the shift \u2013 shortly after she was appointed to the Senate in 2009 to succeed Hillary Clinton \u2013 has opened her up to criticism that she flip-flopped on a key issue for political reasons. Shortly after Gillibrand announced her exploratory bid for the presidency on Tuesday, the Republican National Committee, citing her position on ICE and others, issued a statement attacking her as an opportunist.   Related article Democrats compete for top talent as 2020 kicks into high gear   Meredith Kelly, the communications director for Gillibrand\u2019s exploratory committee, told CNN in a statement, \u201cIt takes courage to admit when you are wrong, and Kirsten has made clear that she regrets positions she took years ago in the House related to immigration.   \u201cSince coming to the Senate and hearing from families all across the state, Kirsten has been a steadfast and compassionate advocate for immigrants, and will continue to drive progress on comprehensive immigration reform, immigrant rights and strengthening the legal immigration system that makes us Americans.\u201d   Gillibrand positioned herself as an immigration hawk during her 2006 campaign for Congress and said securing the southern border was a national security priority.   In a page on her campaign website, still available on the Internet Archive, Gillibrand announced her support for the Secure Fence Act \u2013 a bill that authorized 700 miles of double-layered fence on the border through more than billion dollars in appropriations. (In the Senate, Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton voted for it. In the House, 64 Democrats voted for it, while 131 Democrats voted no.)   In a statement touting her support for the measure, Gillibrand called a secure border a national security priority and said congressional Republicans and her opponent Republican Rep. John Sweeney had failed to take the lead on improving border security.   Related article The 2020 marathon has started with a sprint   \u201cI support protecting our borders, but our solution must include more measures to ensure employer enforcement with regards to illegal immigration, building a wall or a fence alone is simply not enough,\u201d Gillibrand said. \u201cIn conjunction with solutions taken on the ground at our borders, we must enforce the employment laws that are currently being ignored by companies who profit from hiring illegal immigrants. The urgency of dealing with our borders should not be held hostage by election year legislation and this summer\u2019s field hearings; securing our borders must be a national security priority.\u201d   \u201cThreats at our borders need serious solutions from Washington and we have yet to see John Sweeney and Congressional leadership take the lead on improving our border security,\u201d she added. \u201cUnder the Bush Administration, the number of illegal immigrants apprehended at our border is down 31%. This is not solely an immigration question; improving our border security is imperative in keeping America safe.\u201d   Gillibrand won her election, becoming one of a number of Democrats swept into Congress in the 2006 midterm Democratic wave that gave them control of the House for the first time in 12 years.   In Congress, Gillibrand joined the Blue Dog Coalition of moderate Democrats and established herself as a hawk on immigration in the House. Articulating her views in an interview with a local Albany blogger in May 2007, Gillibrand said the borders needed to be closed.   \u201cI think we should be dealing with immigration to \u2018right size\u2019 immigration. First step, you have to close the borders. Second step, you have to increase enforcement dramatically. There has been no enforcement under this past administration,\u201d Gillibrand said, adding the lack of enforcement could mean undocumented immigrants worked in unsafe environments. Gillibrand said workers needed for certain industries would need to come in legally.   Gillibrand\u2019s record on immigration earned her a B rating from Numbers USA, a hardline group that advocates for stricter immigration laws and cuts to legal and illegal immigration.   When then-New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer proposed allowing driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented immigrants, Gillibrand seized on the issue. She co-sponsored a bill with 70 Republicans and two Democrats expressing displeasure at states giving driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants and then co-sponsored a bill with 165 Republicans and 4 Democrats to prevent it.   \u201cIllegal immigrants should not have access to driver\u2019s licenses,\u201d she said in a statement when Spitzer backed down from the plan. \u201cWith regard to illegal immigration, the Bush administration has failed to enforce our laws and secure our borders. Congress needs to act now.\u201d   Related article Gillibrand charts trip to Iowa, making 2020 run look imminent   Gillibrand was also a co-sponsor of the SAVE Act, a bill from Democratic Rep. Heath Shuler, opposed by pro-immigration groups but largely supported by Republicans. The bill was an enforcement-only approach to immigration that would have increased border security by adding 8,000 new border patrol agents, made it easier to deport undocumented immigrants, required companies verify the legal status of their workers and added an additional 1,150 ICE agents.   Gillibrand was one of three co-sponsors to a bill to require that all employers verify they had legal workers through the Social Security Administration, but the bill didn\u2019t move beyond committee.   Gillibrand\u2019s votes frequently aligned her with Republicans and other moderate Democrats and she was often voting in the majority.   She voted in favor of an amendment to increase border fencing and technology by almost $90 million. She also voted in favor of an amendment to increase ICE funding by $9 million to work with local law enforcement to identify and remove undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes. She voted in favor of an amendment from then-Republican Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado, a leading immigration hardliner at the time, that would bar the use of funds in a Department of Homeland Security spending bill from assisting local and state governments that \u201crefuse to share information with the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement on an individual\u2019s citizenship or immigration status.\u201d   Gillibrand also took the issue on herself, passing her own amendment to a bill on federal contracting that would punish employers of undocumented immigrants by barring them from receiving contracts from the federal government. The amendment was passed by a voice vote.   In a press release hailing its passage, Gillibrand\u2019s office called it a \u201ccrack down on illegal immigration.\u201d   \u201cMy amendment to this bill is very simple: businesses that continue to break the law by hiring illegal aliens should not be eligible for federal contracts,\u201d Gillibrand said in a speech on the House floor. \u201cWe must reward businesses that play by the rules and punish those who do not. It is important that we fix our broken immigration system, and an important component of that is to cut off the availability of jobs for undocumented workers \u2013 which can only be done when employers refuse to hire them. There are an estimated 12 million illegal aliens in this country, and if jobs are not available to them, then there will not be an incentive for them to come or remain here in America illegally.\u201d   Gillibrand campaigned heavily on her record on immigration in the House during her first re-election campaign. An issues page on her House website, put up a year into her term, boasted of her voting record in the House, including her support for the SAVE Act and the passage of her amendment, as well as the bill to require employers verify the legal status of their workers.   \u201cI am firmly against providing amnesty to illegal immigrants,\u201d she said on the page.   A page put up on her website for her 2008 re-election campaign similarly boasted about her record, adding that the congresswoman believed that English should be the official language of the United States and no non-emergency taxpayer money should benefit undocumented immigrants.   In May 2008, Gillibrand spent $35,000 of her congressional office\u2019s money to send out an anti-undocumented immigration mailer to her constituents that drew fire from her Republican opponent, Sandy Treadwell, who said Gillibrand should \u201cpay for her self-promotion efforts from her campaign funds, instead of billing taxpayers.\u201d   The mailer, a copy of which CNN\u2019s KFile obtained from the Capitol\u2019s Legislative Resource Center, touted how Gillibrand\u2019s sponsorship of the SAVE Act would increase the speed in which undocumented immigrants were deported.   One page of the mailer featured a photo of a hole on the southern border fence with a later page showing it covered by a sign boasting Gillibrand \u201copposes amnesty for illegal immigrants.\u201d   In January 2009, Gillibrand was appointed to replace Clinton, who had been confirmed to be President Barack Obama\u2019s new secretary of state. Her appointment was met with backlash from New York-based immigration activists.   El Diario Nueva York, one of the largest Spanish language newspapers in the state, published a cover story on Gillibrand. The headline \u201cAnti Inmigrante,\u201d ran under a photo of then-congresswoman. The newspaper\u2019s editorial board called her \u201can unfortunate selection.\u201d   Gillibrand sought to quell the concerns by meeting with immigration groups. After meeting with activists, Gillibrand announced that she supported several more liberal positions on the issue, like a moratorium on raids until comprehensive immigration reform was achieved.   The meetings seemed to work.   \u201cWe saw a very positive shift in attitude in the way that she looks at immigrant constituencies,\u201d said Chung-Wha Hong, former executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, who met with Gillibrand, to the New York Daily News at the time.   New York Assemblyman Peter Rivera was going to have a press conference announcing his \u201ctotal opposition\u201d to Gillibrand before it was canceled after aides to the new senator reached out. Rivera soon announced he no longer saw her as anti-immigrant.   Related article Democrats are getting ready to run in 2020. Who has the money advantage?   \u201cOnly time will tell where she\u2019s going to end up on this,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cBut from what I\u2019ve seen from all her statements and all her stance, she\u2019s with the immigrant community 110%. I cannot now say that she\u2019s anti-immigrant. She\u2019s become a strong supporter of immigrant issues in the state and the nation, in the course of a week. I really didn\u2019t think she could move that fast on the issue, that she\u2019d be bound by complexity and the traditions of life.\u201d   Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat and former chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, talked about Gillibrand\u2019s shift on the issue in a statement to CNN.   \u201cWhile I am not endorsing a candidate at this time, I consider Kirsten a friend and, almost a decade ago, I witnessed firsthand the meaningful evolution of her thinking on immigration,\u201d Velazquez said. \u201cVery shortly after becoming Senator, she reached out to me directly and we had multiple conversations where she listened, learned and demonstrated genuine compassion for what families across New York have experienced from our broken immigration system. Since then, she\u2019s been a fighter and a tireless ally on these issues who I deeply value.\u201d   Gillibrand moved in the Senate to support policies advocated by the activists, including in March 2009, when she signed on as a co-sponsor of the DREAM Act.   Gillibrand was asked about her past positions in a 2018 interview with 60 Minutes, where she said, \u201cI just didn\u2019t take the time to understand why these issues mattered because it wasn\u2019t right in front of me. And that was my fault. It was something that I\u2019m embarrassed about and I\u2019m ashamed of.\u201d   She added, \u201cI just think as I\u2019ve gotten older I\u2019ve learned more about life and sometimes you\u2019re wrong. And you\u2019ve gotta fix it. And if you\u2019re wrong, just admit it and move on.\u201d   Clarification: This story has been updated to more precisely describe Numbers USA.

Tulsi Gabbard in the early 2000s touted working for her father\u2019s anti-gay organization, which mobilized to pass a measure against same-sex marriage in Hawaii and promoted controversial conversion therapy.   Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii, said Friday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Van Jones that she will seek her party\u2019s nomination for president in 2020. Her past views and activism in opposition to LGBT rights in the late 90s and early 2000s, which put her out of step with most of the Democratic Party at the time, have come under more intense scrutiny since her announcement.   Although Gabbard\u2019s positions on LGBT rights have shifted dramatically in more recent years (she signed a 2013 amicus brief supporting Edith Windsor\u2019s challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act), the extent of Gabbard\u2019s past anti-gay activism has already drawn criticism from prominent Democrats and will likely be a major issue for her as she seeks the party\u2019s nomination.   In a statement to CNN provided after the initial publication of this story, Gabbard said, \u201cFirst, let me say I regret the positions I took in the past, and the things I said. I\u2019m grateful for those in the LGBTQ+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey.\u201d   She continued, \u201cOver the past six years in Congress, I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to help work toward passing legislation that ensures equal rights and protections on LGBTQ+ issues, such as the Equality Act, the repeal of DOMA, Restore Honor to Service members Act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, the Safe Schools Improvement Act and the Equality for All Resolution. Much work remains to ensure equality and civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans and if elected President, I will continue to fight for equal rights for all.\u201d   Four days after CNN KFile\u2019s report published, Gabbard further apologized, releasing a four-minute-long video on YouTube saying, \u201cIn my past, I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were very hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones.\u201d   Gabbard\u2019s past positions can be traced back to the early 2000s, when she first sought public office.   During her run for state legislature in 2002, Gabbard told the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, \u201cWorking with my father, Mike Gabbard, and others to pass a constitutional amendment to protect traditional marriage, I learned that real leaders are willing to make personal sacrifices for the common good. I will bring that attitude of public service to the legislature.\u201d The quote, which CNN\u2019s KFile found during a review of Gabbard\u2019s early career, shows how closely she aligned herself with her father\u2019s mission at the time.   Gabbard\u2019s father ran The Alliance for Traditional Marriage, a political action committee aimed at opposing pro-gay lawmakers and legislation that organized and spent more than $100,000 to pass an amendment in 1998 that gave the Hawaii state legislature power to \u201creserve marriage to opposite-sex couples.\u201d The amendment to the state\u2019s constitution passed.   Gabbard was 17 at the time of the vote and cited working with her father and the organization during her run for the state legislature in Hawaii four years later when she was age 21. Gabbard would win her race, becoming the youngest woman elected to the Hawaii state legislature.   Gabbard\u2019s father Mike was a prominent anti-gay activist in Hawaii. He was also the director of Stop Promoting Homosexuality and also served on the steering committees of the National Campaign to Protect Marriage and the Hawaii-based coalition, Save Traditional Marriage. He also once hosted an anti-gay radio show, Let\u2019s Talk Straight Hawaii.   Related article Tulsi Gabbard says she will run for president in 2020   The Alliance for Traditional Marriage called homosexuality \u201cunhealthy, abnormal behavior that should not be promoted or accepted in society.\u201d   Listed among Gabbard\u2019s past work in the profile by the Honolulu newspaper was her work at The Alliance for Traditional Marriage.   A CNN KFile review of the organization\u2019s website, which is archived on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, uncovers the organization supported controversial gay conversion therapy, which treats homosexuality as a mental illness that can be fixed. The practice is opposed by the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association and has been banned for use on minors in 14 states and D.C., including Hawaii in 2018.   \u201cOur win in Hawaii, along with Alaska\u2019s victory, sends a very clear message to the homosexual movement-we do not want homosexual marriage advocates forcing their values on our communities,\u201d Tulsi\u2019s father Mike wrote in a message on the website of the group shortly after the passage of the constitutional amendment in 1998.   \u201cIt is now a time for healing and moving on,\u201d he added. \u201cWhile we must continue to monitor and respond to homosexual activists whose ultimate goal is societal acceptance of homosexuality on an equal basis as heterosexuality, we must also renew our efforts to reach out with love and compassion to those who are addicted to homosexual behavior, and encourage them to seek help through the National Association of Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), \u2018ex-gay\u2019 ministries such as Exodus International, Courage, Homosexuals Anonymous and Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays (P-FOX).\u201d   Tulsi Gabbard herself is quoted in a 2000 press release from The Alliance for Traditional Marriage. In it, she attacks gay rights activists who were opposed to her mother Carol\u2019s bid for the state\u2019s board of education.   \u201cThis war of deception and hatred against my mom is being waged by homosexual activists because they know, that if elected, she will not allow them to force their values down the throats of the children in our schools,\u201d Gabbard is quoted as saying.   Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s anti-gay efforts continued after she became a state representative.   Shortly after Gabbard announced her presidential ambitions Friday, her testimony at a hearing opposing a civil unions bill in 2004 resurfaced.   \u201cTo try to act as if there is a difference between \u2018civil unions\u2019 and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii,\u201d Gabbard said at the time. \u201cAs Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.\u201d   The resurfaced comments drew condemnation from former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, the first governor in America to support civil unions and who sought the Democratic nomination in 2004.   \u201cI was on the other side of this argument wearing a bulletproof vest while she was saying this,\u201d Dean tweeted.   In 2012, when running for Congress, Gabbard apologized to LGBT activists in Hawaii for her past comments.   \u201cI want to apologize for statements that I have made in the past that have been very divisive and even disrespectful to those within the LGBT community,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cI know that those comments have been hurtful and I sincerely offer my apology to you and hope that you will accept it.\u201d   Since joining Congress in 2013, Gabbard has supported efforts to promote LGBT equality, including co-sponsoring pro-LGBT legislation like The Equality Act, a bill to amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to protect LGBT individuals.   \u201cI grew up in a very kind of conservative household. A multi-ethnic, multi-racial, multi-faith home,\u201d Gabbard said in New Hampshire in December, speaking to her shift. \u201cDiverse in our makeup and diverse in our views. And I held views growing up that I no longer hold.\u201d   Citing her time deployed overseas, Gabbard said she saw \u201cthe destructive effect of having governments who act as moral arbiters for their people.\u201d   \u201cThat caused me to really deeply reflect and be introspective on the values and beliefs that I had grown up with what I was experiencing there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then coming back and eventually running for office again. And the conflict that I saw there, in standing for, believing strongly in, and fighting for these ideals of freedom and liberty that we hold dear in this country. It means that equality, that our laws, our government must apply that respect for every single individual. For people who choose to love or marry someone \u2013 whether they be of the same gender or not, that respect, and that freedom for every woman to be able to make her own choice about her body and her family and her future. So it was a process that I went through that changed my views in many ways and in many big ways to the views that I hold today.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Stick with CNN Politics on Tuesday to see how America votes.   President Trump hit Senator Claire McCaskill in Missouri Monday night, telling the crowd that any support she has been declaring for Trump will disappear the day after the election.   \u201cShe was going down and then she said the Democrats are crazy \u2013 and I said that\u2019s genius for getting elected,\u201d Trump joked to the crowd adding that he appreciate she\u2019s support \u201cout of nowhere\u201d on the border.   Trump said that the Senator was \u201cgetting a lot of heat\u201d from Democrats, but warned the crowd that she would make up with democrats the day after the election at \u201clunch.\u201d   Trump also hit McCaskill for not voting for several of his referendums saying she will \u201cbe a disaster\u201d if elected again.   Trump then invited McCaskill\u2019s opponent, Josh Hawley, to the stage in Missouri.   President Trump, at his 11th and closing rally of the final week before the midterms, told the crowd in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, \u201cIf we don\u2019t do so well tomorrow, they will put me on the ticket. If we do great tomorrow, they will say he has nothing to do with it.\u201d   With just hours until polls open in the 2018 midterm elections, Facebook said\u00a0Monday night\u00a0that it had taken down a network of Facebook and Instagram pages, acting on a tip from US law enforcement.   \u201cOn Sunday evening, US law enforcement contacted us about online activity that they recently discovered and which they believe may be linked to foreign entities,\u201d Nathaniel Gleicher, the company\u2019s head of cybersecurity, said in a statement.   The company removed 30 Facebook accounts and 85 Instagram accounts, the statement read.   \u201cAlmost all the Facebook Pages associated with these accounts appear to be in the French or Russian languages, while the Instagram accounts seem to have mostly been in English \u2014 some were focused on celebrities, others political debate,\u201d Gleicher wrote.   \u201cOnce we know more \u2014 including whether these accounts are linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency or other foreign entities \u2014 we will update this post,\u201d he added.   Facebook\u2019s release comes after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a joint statement Monday that there was no indication of a compromise of America\u2019s voting infrastructure.   \u201cAmericans should be aware that foreign actors \u2014 and Russia in particular \u2014continue to try to influence public sentiment and voter perceptions through actions intended to sow discord. They can do this by spreading false information about political processes and candidates, lying about their own interference activities, disseminating propaganda on social media, and through other tactics.\u201d   Fox News host Sean Hannity appeared on stage beside Trump and thanked him for his work at a rally in Missouri Monday night, despite saying only hours earlier that he would not hit the stump for the President.   Hannity began by approaching the lectern and telling the audience, \u201cby the way, all those people in the back are fake news,\u201d pointing to members of the media located in a press pen.   \u201cI had no idea you were going to invite me up here, and the one thing that has made and defined your presidency more than anything else: Promises Made, Promises Kept,\u201d Hannity said, echoing the slogan on a banner that appeared behind the President\u2019s lectern.   Hannity then went on to tout improvements in the economy since Trump took office and lauded his decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal.   \u201cMr. President, thank you,\u201d Hannity concluded.     Hannity had previously said in a tweet that he \u201cwill not be on stage campaigning with the President. I am covering final rally for my show.\u201d   Hannity\u2019s colleague at Fox, Jeanine Pirro, appeared on stage after him.   Hannity is not a journalist, but he works at a hugely popular network with \u201cNews\u201d in its name, alongside staffers who have to follow policies that forbid this type of political involvement.   Perhaps that\u2019s why Fox News reacted to the press release by saying that Hannity was not sponsoring the rally or campaigning for Trump.   Hannity hosted his 9 p.m. show from the rally site, and he interviewed Trump there.   The White House\u2019s communications team, led by\u00a0former Fox News co-president Bill Shine, set up a similar on-site interview in Las Vegas in September. Trump arrived at the arena, walked up to Hannity\u2019s stage for a live chat, then began his rally.   But the Trump campaign isn\u2019t making a distinction between interviewing the president and showing up at the rally as a \u201cspecial guest.\u201d The campaign\u2019s website encourages people to sign up for tickets to the event \u201cw/Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, & Lee Greenwood.\u201d   Read more here  What's the significance of Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh showing up at Trump's midterms finale rally? Given the trends favoring Democrats, @PastPunditry says it's \"more a show of solidarity than a celebration of success.\" https://t.co/MXyGLaRGxX  President Trump has just arrived at his third and final rally in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.   Before he takes the stage, Trump will speak to Sean Hannity live on Fox News.   Hannity anchored the first half of his show from the rally \u2013 he\u2019s interviewing POTUS backstage. There are only a few minutes left of Hannity\u2019s show, but they could always go into the next hour.   Hannity has had a slew of Trump supporters on his show today, including Judge Jeanine live here in Missouri.   Once the rally starts, you can watch Trump live here.   Former Vice President Joe Biden grasped the microphone tightly as he delivered his closing pitch for Democrats, his normally booming voice gone after a week of campaigning and replaced with something much lower and hoarse.   Biden\u2019s mission over the past week was straightforward: help Democrats make their closing argument heading into Tuesday\u2019s elections. But his six day, eight-state campaign swing, which took him to college campuses, union halls, suburb fairgrounds and even the early nominating state of Iowa, also carried the trappings of an opening act with chants of \u201cRun Joe Run!\u201d filling many of his 12 rallies over the last week.   \u201cThe only thing strong enough to tear apart America is America itself, and we\u2019ve seen it start, and we have to stop it and that\u2019s what Tuesday\u2019s about,\u201d Biden said Sunday in Yatesville just a few miles from his birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania, a city upon which he\u2019s centered much of his blue collar, middle-class message.   \u201cWe have to make clear that Democrats, Democrats choose hope over fear. Democrats choose unity over division, and most importantly, we choose truth over lies.\u201d     \u201cIt\u2019s time to get up. Remember who in the hell we are. This is America,\u201d added Biden, who was struck with laryngitis over his last few days of campaigning.   Keep reading.   Oprah fired back against a racist robocall impersonating her, and said Monday, \u201cJesus don\u2019t like ugly.\u201d   \u201cI heard people were making racist robocalls in my name against Stacey Abrams, who I am one hundred percent for, in Georgia,\u201d Oprah says in an Instagram video. \u201cI just want to say: Jesus don\u2019t like ugly. Mm - mmm! And we know what to do about that: vote. Tomorrow show up and show out, and vote,\u201d she says, singing the last \u201cvote.\u201d  A post shared by Oprah (@oprah)  A white supremacist group that targeted Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum with racist robocalls is now targeting Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.   The prerecorded phone message features a voice impersonating Winfrey, who was in Georgia on Thursday stumping for Abrams, and contains racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric.   The robocall went out to Georgia voters, but it is unclear how many received it.   Abrams\u2019 Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, strongly denounced the automated call, calling it \u201cabsolutely disgusting\u201d in a statement Friday.   Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Republican who has been critical of President Trump who has hinted he may consider a 2020 primary challenge, urged voters on election eve to get out and help \u201cdrive the change.\u201d   \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that we can do together,\u201d Kasich told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cIn the meantime, you and I and all these people that watch \u2013 start doing things where you live and drive the change from where you live to the top. It will work.\u201d   Watch:  Republican Gov. @JohnKasich\u2019s message to voters on election eve: \u201cThere's a lot that we can do together. In the meantime, you and I and all these people that watch \u2013\u2013 start doing things where you live and drive the change from where you live to the top. It will work.\u201d pic.twitter.com/TOS6IRIspn  In Cape Girardeau tonight, inside the Show Me Center on the campus of Southeast Missouri State University, President Trump\u2019s supporters are filing into the arena after standing outside for hours in the rain.   A familiar sight has returned for the final Trump rally of the 2018 campaign: A Fox News set on the floor of the arena, not far from the President.   There was no sign of host Sean Hannity on set yet, but the lights and cameras for his show were up and ready. His set up was about 10 to 20 yards away from the presidential lectern. (Fox News is apparently allowing Hannity to appear as a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at Trump\u2019s final rally of the midterm season.) Hannity was spotted in the crowd at the rally.   It is unclear how the Trump interview will take place since he would seem to arrive after the\u00a0Hannity show begins.   Rush Limbaugh told listeners of his show today that he will speak before the President \u2014 and warns against anyone giving him the hook in his hometown.   Limbaugh said: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it. I have\u2026 You know, I\u2019ve sworn off of these kinds of things some time ago, but they asked \u2014 they were very persuasive \u2014 and I\u2019m actually thrilled to be there\u2026   \u201cThey\u2019ve given me a time frame in which to speak, which \u2014 I\u2019m just telling you right now \u2014 it will be impossible for me to be constrained by this time frame, and I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s gonna grab the hook in my hometown. But, just in case, I\u2019m gonna do everything I can to keep it to the limit. But I\u2019m not gonna tell you what the limit is.\u00a0No. Nobody\u2019s ever grabbed the hook. Not that they haven\u2019t wanted to, but nobody has ever grabbed the hook.\u201d   A GOP congressional aide expressed concerns that an immigration message will likely fall flat or even backfire in the suburbs of Virginia,\u00a0Pennsylvania, Florida and California \u2014 places where Republicans are on defense as they face independent, fiscally conservative \u2014 but not culturally conservative \u2014 people.   Republican officials have pushed President Trump to champion an economic message for the sake of races in those states and districts like them.   \u201cIf that drowns everything out, and that\u2019s all people hear, it becomes a challenge,\u201d the aide said of the immigration message.   However, White House officials claim to have data showing Trump\u2019s immigration message has moved key voters.   The congressional aide pushing back: \u201cI\u2019ve not seen any data that swing voters, independents are won over by immigration message.\u201d     Republicans have trailed Democrats in voter enthusiasm for months, and Trump has hoped his focus on immigration will motivate otherwise complacent GOP voters to head to the polls on Tuesday.   But the aide said Trump would benefit swing districts more if he drew a fundamental contrast with Democrats on the economy \u2014 particularly by warning that Democrats, if given power, would raise taxes and over-regulate the economy.   \u201cThe contrast works well for us in all districts, especially one in districts that are important,\u201d the aide said.   One possible reason Trump\u2019s focused on the issue:\u00a0A source close to the White House argued the decision to focus primarily on immigration \u2014 at the expense of any other issue \u2014 is in part data driven. The data White House officials have been analyzing, according to the source, shows people care less about the economy right now and much more about immigration and health care.   \u201cIf he talks about the economy, people are tuning out, because right now, people aren\u2019t worried about the economy,\u201d the source said. By contrast, the data shows the national mood is more focused on immigration, with headlines about the migrant caravan dominating headlines.   Trump acknowledged the lack of interest in economic talk Friday at his rally in West Virginia. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s not as exciting to talk about the economy because we have a lot of other things to talk about,\u201d Trump said.   The source said the timing of Trump\u2019s immigration push worked well because, although it\u2019s an issue that the President has been touting for several years, \u201cit all matches up now\u201d with immigration being a top concern, even though the caravan of Central American migrants is more than 600 hundred miles from the border.   President Trump, asked to reflect on any regrets from his first years as President while traveling to a rally, told CNN affiliate Sinclair earlier this evening, \u201cI would like to have a much softer tone.\u201d   Scott Thuman/Sinclair: \u201cIs there anything as you look back at your first almost two years that you regret, that you wish on you, that you could just take back and redo?\u201d   President Trump: \u201cWell there would be certain things, I\u2019m not sure I want to reveal all of them but I would say tone, I would like to have a much softer tone. I feel to a certain extent I have no choice, but maybe I do, and maybe I could\u2019ve been softer from that standpoint\u2026\u201d  .@GloriaBorger: President Trump is beginning to understand that \u201cwomen are just deserting the Republican Party in droves,\u201d in part due to his rhetoric. https://t.co/AQVa7PSVV2 pic.twitter.com/hu5g0lVkah  President Trump invited three of his White House\u00a0aides on stage during his campaign rally Monday in Indiana to help bolster his message.   The aides \u2014 senior adviser Ivanka Trump, press secretary Sarah Sanders, and counselor Kellyanne Conway \u2014 all made pitches for Republicans.   \u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive Kellyanne and I. We may be a little speechless, we\u2019re not used to friendly crowds,\u201d Sanders said to cheers.   Conway was more forceful when she took the podium, declaring: \u201cJoe (Donnelly) Must Go. Get him out.\u201d   Both Sanders and Conway seemed cognizant\u00a0of not falling afoul of Hatch Act violations that prevent government employees from using their positions for political activity. Conway said she was speaking in a \u201cpersonal capacity\u201d because the election meant a lot to her personally.   And Sanders made reference to her \u201cofficial capacity,\u201d saying she was not speaking in that role during the rally.   Watch the moment:   More than 14 million tweets have been sent about voting and early voting since Oct. 1, according to Twitter spokesperson Nick Pacilio.   People are also tweeting about this year\u2019s candidates. These are the 10 who were mentioned the most in the past week:   After arriving in Indiana on Monday afternoon, President Trump shrugged off the prospects of Democrats going after his tax returns if they win back the House.   \u201cI don\u2019t care. They can do whatever they want, and I can do whatever I want,\u201d Trump said at Fort Wayne International Airport.   He also said that \u201cwe\u2019ll just have to work a little bit differently\u201d if Democrats win the House\u00a0on Tuesday, though he didn\u2019t elaborate on how.   \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing very well in the House, we\u2019re doing very well in the Senate.\u201d   He is in Indiana to campaign for Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun, who stood next to Trump as the President as he spoke to reporters.   \u201cHe\u2019s (Braun) run a brilliant campaign, the polls just came out, he\u2019s actually leading by a little bit,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMike is going to have a great victory.\u201d   Braun is facing off against Democrat Joe Donnelly in one of the marquee Senate contests of this year\u2019s midterm elections.   Despite a busy campaign schedule the last two weeks, with sometimes two or three rallies a day, President Trump has nothing on his schedule tomorrow, a White House official tells CNN.   His plan is to sit back, watch the results roll in and see if his campaigning blitz paid off.   The call to vote is plastered across America. Artists, activists and brands have taken to the streets to get out the vote with visual representations meant to convey the importance of Tuesday\u2019s election.   Lyft, which is offering 50% off for rides to polling places Tuesday, covered a wall in the Lower East Side with mock ballots. Tinder has an \u201cEvery \u2018Single\u2019 Vote Counts\u201d campaign in multiple cities, and Patagonia pledged to give employees time off to vote.   Instagram post not found.   Post has been removed or is no longer public.   In New York, \u201cvote\u201d has turned into a street art tag, seen on sidewalks and signposts. In the Times Square subway station, \u201cI\u2019m Voting\u201d stickers were stuck on people featured in ads for Bumble.   Some of the street art is candidate-specific. In Houston, artist Anat Ronan painted \u201cVote Beto\u201d with an image of Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke Superman-style, and artist Fabian Williams created a mural of gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams with the word \u201cvote\u201d in an Atlanta bar.   Republican Brian Kemp\u2019s Georgia gubernatorial campaign is targeting Democrat Stacey Abrams with calls to voters in the final days of the election that feature several false claims.   Among the falsehoods are claims that Abrams is trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election with undocumented immigrant voters, that Abrams supports impeaching President\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump, and that Abrams was endorsed by Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.   \u201cRadical Stacey Abrams is so extreme that she wants to allow illegal immigrants to vote in this election,\u201d\u00a0a robocall from the\u00a0Kemp campaign says. \u201cWe can\u2019t let her steal this election. It\u2019s up to you to stop her.\u201d   Another phone bank call\u00a0from the Kemp campaign says Abrams wants to give undocumented immigrants \u201cthe right to vote.\u201d   Cody Hall, a spokesman for the Kemp campaign, pointed to comments from Abrams during a campaign stop\u00a0this month\u00a0with\u00a0Massachusetts\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren, where she said undocumented immigrants were part \u201cof the Blue Wave.\u201d He also pointed to\u00a0a 2009 vote\u00a0against requiring a citizenship check before voting. In neither instance did Abrams say she supported giving undocumented immigrants the right to vote in the election.   Another call from the campaign\u00a0claims Abrams is \u201cendorsed by Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi,\u201d and \u201cStacey Abrams has even said she supports the impeachment of President Trump.\u201d   While Clinton did endorse Abrams, Pelosi hasn\u2019t announced an endorsement of Abrams and isn\u2019t involved in the race.   Jorge Aguilar, a spokesman for Pelosi, said she only endorses in House races.   Abrams has also never said she supports impeaching Trump.\u00a0In May, she said\u00a0impeachment is\u00a0\u201cabsolutely a lever we need to look at\u201d but only if it was shown that the President had \u201ccommitted high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d   Abigail Collazo, director of strategic communications for Abrams, blasted the last-minute calls.   \u201cLies, false accusations, and misleading calls have become the hallmark of Brian Kemp\u2019s increasingly desperate campaign,\u201d Collazo said.   President Trump, who was in Ohio campaigning for gubernatorial candidate Mike DeWine, spent a good portion of the rally bashing Democratic candidate Richard Cordray, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   \u201cMike\u2019s opponent, who was in my administration for a short while, who is \u2013 by the way, terrible, terrible \u2013 is a far-left, radical socialist, and not a good person,\u201d Trump said.   Trump tied Cordray to Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, perhaps previewing the 2020 message that will be underway the minute the votes are counted tomorrow.   \u201cHe\u2019s a disciple of Elizabeth Warren, who I can no longer call Pocahontas because she has no Indian blood. She has no Indian blood!\u201d\u00a0Trump said.   Trump recalled that he used to go around saying that he has \u201cmore Indian blood\u201d than Warren, boasting, \u201cAnd I was right!\u201d   At a Montana rally on Monday, Vice President Mike Pence predicted a Republican victory in Tuesday\u2019s midterm election.   \u201cI keep hearing about this blue wave that\u2019s coming our way,\u201d said Pence in Kalispell, Montana. \u201cBut I got to tell you, I got to tell you, it kind of reminds me of a couple years ago today. I mean was standing \u2014 I was standing there with a man who would become President of the United States.\u201d   He recounted the final rally that he and President Trump attended in Michigan, saying, \u201cYou know, that was the night he turned the blue wall red, remember? And I got a feeling that blue wave is gonna hit a red wall right here in Montana and all across America.\u201d   Pence campaigned for Montana Senate candidate Matt Rosendale and Rep. Greg Gianforte. Later on Monday, he will head to Rapid City, South Dakota, to campaign for Rep. Kristi Noem, who is running for governor.   President Trump conducted a poll of the Cleveland crowd Monday afternoon, saying that voters need to imagine he\u2019s on the ticket.   He also warned what would happen if Republicans don\u2019t get out the vote.   \u201cWho has already voted?\u201d he asked the crowd, pausing, and then determining, \u201cThis is very much a Tuesday state.\u201d   He tried again:\u00a0\u201cWho is going to vote on Tuesday?\u201d he said to loud applause and cheers.   \u201cDon\u2019t forget, don\u2019t forget!\u201d he told the Ohioans.   Trump repeated, as he said in Missouri, that midterm elections \u201cused to be boring.\u201d   \u201cNow it\u2019s like the hottest thing,\u201d he said of the local and state races.     \u201cThese guys are making a fortune because of me and you. That\u2019s true,\u201d he said, gesturing to the media.   Trump continued:\u00a0\u201cI mean,\u00a0who ever even heard of midterm?\u201d   He told the crowd that when they cast their ballots, they should imagine\u00a0him on the ticket.   \u201cIn a sense, I am on the ticket, you\u2019ve gotta go out to vote,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou\u00a0have to protect your rights and your freedoms.\u201d   The President repeated his \u201cDemocrats produce mobs, Republicans produce jobs\u201d tagline, warning the crowd, \u201cIf crying Chuck Schumer. Nancy Pelosi, [boos] and the legendary Maxine Waters [boos] gain the majority, they will try to raise your taxes, restore job-killing regulations, shut down your coal mines and your steel mills\u2026 take away your healthcare.\u201d   Trump claimed that under Democrat control, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna live in a socialist world.\u201d   On the eve of Election Day, President Trump raised the specter of undocumented immigrants casting illegal ballots, claiming to have proof that some people attempt to do this.   \u201cAll you have to do is go around, take a look at what\u2019s happened over the years, and you\u2019ll see,\u201d Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews on Monday.     \u201cThere are a lot of people, a lot of people in my opinion \u2013 and based on proof \u2013 that try and get in illegally and actually vote illegally,\u201d he said, offering no examples. \u201cWe just want to let them know there will be prosecutions at the highest level.\u201d   His comments came just hours after he tweeted a warning to law enforcement officials about the possibility of voter fraud.   \u201cLaw enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesday\u2019s Election (or Early Voting),\u201d Trump tweeted on Monday morning. \u201cAnyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law. Thank you!\u201d   It\u2019s unlikely: There is well-established evidence that voter fraud is extremely rare. For example, stealing someone\u2019s identity to vote is less likely than being struck by lightning, as the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law put it.   In addition, election researchers and experts around the country who spoke to CNN ahead of the 2018 midterm elections all agreed that there is zero evidence for widespread voter fraud, whether by citizens or non-citizens.   A significant storm system is taking shape over the middle of the country and it could bring nasty weather to the Northeast, Midwest and South on Election Day.   An area of low pressure moving through the Midwest into the Great Lakes will spark strong storms along a trailing cold front, and it will bring severe weather to parts of the South on Monday night.   The storms will be ongoing into Tuesday and could mean a stormy start to the polling day for many states from the Great Lakes all the way to the Gulf Coast.   Every state east of the Mississippi River is likely to see rain at some point when the polls are open on Tuesday, though some states will undoubtedly see more storms and potentially disruptive weather than others.   Here\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting:   Several of\u00a0CNN\u2019s top ten races to watch\u00a0will be impacted by the weather, including Virginia\u2019s 7th District, New Jersey\u2019s 7th District, Georgia\u2019s 6th District and Florida\u2019s governor\u2019s race.   You can find more on the weather across the country here.   President Trump has three campaign rallies in three states today, the last day before the midterm elections.   First, he\u2019s heading to Cleveland, Ohio, for a 2:45 p.m. ET rally. After that, he\u2019ll rally in Fort Wayne, Indiana around 6 p.m. ET.   His last stop is Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Fox News host Sean Hannity is expected to appear as a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at the 10 p.m. ET rally.   President Trump deflected criticism of a controversial immigration ad that networks, including Fox News and CNN, declined to air, although he said he was unaware of the controversy surrounding the ad.   \u201cA lot of things are offensive,\u201d Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews when asked about the ad. \u201cYour questions are offensive.\u201d   The President said the reporter asking him about the controversial ad was telling him something he did not already know.   \u201cWe have a lot of ads. And they certainly are effective, based on the numbers that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Trump added.   The death of Brent Taylor \u2013 the North Ogden, Utah, mayor and soldier who was killed Saturday in Afghanistan \u2013 reverberated far beyond his small city in northern Utah.   People around the country are mourning the loss of the National Guardsman who was finishing up his latest tour of duty in the war-torn country when he was killed in a so-called \u201cinsider\u201d attack.   But despite the grief, many are finding hope in the final message Taylor posted to Facebook, just days before he died:   \u201cAs the USA gets ready to vote in our own election (Tuesday), I hope everyone back home exercises their precious right to vote,\u201d Taylor wrote in the post. \u201cAnd that whether the Republicans or the Democrats win, that we all remember that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us. \u2018United we stand, divided we fall.\u2019 God Bless America.\u201d   See it:  Freedom: Millions Defy Taliban and Vote in Afghan Elections  \u201cThe secret to happiness is freedom\u2026 And the secret to...  Read more about Brent Taylor.   You may be tempted to post a photo on Instagram when you hit the voting booth on Tuesday \u2014 but selfies with your ballot could get you in trouble in some states.   There are 18 states that don\u2019t allow photographs in polling places or voting booths, or both. Granted, the laws aren\u2019t often enforced. (It\u2019s more of a \u201csomeone gently asks you to stop\u201d kind of thing.) But that doesn\u2019t mean you should test the rules.   Avoid selfies here:   But that doesn\u2019t mean other states are safe to selfie in: Some states have laws against photographing your ballot and others generally discourage the polling place portrait. Read up on every state\u2019s laws here.   Why are federal elections always in November, and always on Tuesdays? It all comes down to weather, harvests and worship.   Back when voters traveled to the polls by horse, Tuesday was an ideal day because it allows people to worship on Sunday, ride to their county seat on Monday and vote on Tuesday \u2014 all before market day, Wednesday.   And the month of November fit nicely between harvest time and brutal winter weather (which can be especially bad when you\u2019re trudging along by horse and buggy).   The tradition stuck, even though many voters now travel by horsepower instead of live horses.   President Trump on Monday stressed the importance of voting in the midterm elections on Tuesday in a conference call with supporters organized by his campaign.   \u201cThe election tomorrow is very vital,\u201d Trump said as he warned his supporters that the election results will be viewed as a referendum on his presidency and his political movement.   While Trump has previously urged his supporters to act as if he is on the ballot in the midterms, the President on Monday suggested it is only the media that is portraying the midterms as a referendum on his presidency.   \u201cMany of them are saying it\u2019s a referendum on what we\u2019ve done. I don\u2019t know about that \u2026 but that\u2019s how they\u2019re going to play it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a good day they will make it like it\u2019s the end of the world. Don\u2019t worry if we do have a good day they won\u2019t give us any credit.\u201d   Later, he added: \u201cI\u2019m not on the ballot \u2014 in a certain way I am on the ballot. Whether we consider it or not the press is very much considering it a referendum on me and us as a movement.\u201d   Trump predicted Republicans will \u201cdo pretty well,\u201d based on the latest polling he has seen and the \u201cenergy\u201d in recent weeks among Republicans.   The President also warned supporters that Democratic victories could unfurl all of his presidency\u2019s accomplishments.   \u201cIt\u2019s all fragile,\u201d Trump said of those policy accomplishments. \u201cIt can be undone and changed by the Democrats.\u201d   The Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division will send personnel to 35 jurisdictions in 19 states to monitor compliance with federal voting rights laws, the department announced this morning.   \u201cThis year we are using every lawful tool that we have, both civil and criminal, to protect the rights of millions of Americans to cast their vote unimpeded at one of more than 170,000 precincts across America,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement.     Here\u2019s the full list of the 35 jurisdictions where Justice Department teams will be watching:   White House officials have advised President Trump to brace for Republican losses in the House ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, multiple sources tell CNN.   How this has affected his tone: That sense of caution regarding Tuesday\u2019s outcome has been reflected in Trump\u2019s remarks, as he has stated repeatedly in recent days that it would be impossible for his to campaign for all the House races and has focused on the Senate instead.   \u201cAs you know, my primary focus has been on the Senate, and I think we\u2019re doing really well in the Senate,\u201d Trump told reporters before boarding Marine One Sunday.     Trump has resisted calls from advisers inside and outside the White House to focus on the roaring economy in his closing argument to voters, telling them he believes it\u2019s immigration that\u2019s energized his supporters. But it\u2019s not all pushback \u2014 multiple allies have told the President his instincts are correct on this.   Separately, a source confirms that Trump had a call about the midterm elections with House Speaker Paul Ryan Sunday. The two men disagreed in recent days after Ryan flatly dismissed his suggestion he could unilaterally undo birthright citizenship.   Jen Psaki, a CNN political commentator, was the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration.   I have been through election weeks on campaigns many times before.   As the traveling press secretary twice for President Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns, as one of the spokespeople for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee when we won back the House in 2006, as a junior press staffer on John Kerry\u2019s losing presidential bid, and in Iowa during the successful re-elections of both former Governor Vilsack and former Senator Harkin in 2002.   I always thought I knew what victory, and loss, felt like.   When you win, it is a feeling of elation, often followed by extreme fatigue. When you lose, it is disappointment and second-guessing, followed by extreme fatigue. I am far from the first person to say that 2016 was different. I wasn\u2019t a part of the campaign, but I was in the White House working for President Obama as his communications director.   The aftermath of the election was of course shock, but not just because of the fact that President-elect Donald Trump and not President-elect Hilary Clinton was coming to the White House the following day. It was a shock because of what it said about the country we lived in.     Yes, we had missed something, along with nearly every other political prognosticator on both sides of the aisle, about the anger and dissatisfaction of large swaths of white America who had long voted for Democrats. Yes, Russia had intervened, and the dire impact of the propaganda campaign run effectively online by the Kremlin was still unknown, and its full extent still even is today. And yes, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.   But it was supposed to be a shellacking, a win strong enough to carry the Electoral College. In part, our confidence stemmed from an assumption that the fight against racism, misogyny and bigotry would win out. That as a country we had made tremendous progress. That we had, all together as Americans, \u201cbent the moral arc toward justice.\u201d That even if Donald Trump was a more effective campaigner than his opponent, there was no way the country could vote for him. And we were dead wrong.   Read more from Jen Psaki here.   Here\u2019s something scary: Even if you have the legal right to vote and have done everything to prepare yourself for Election Day, you could still be turned away at the polls.   In recent years, almost two dozen US states have implemented laws that impose new restrictions on voting,\u00a0which critics say disproportionally affect minority voters.   So, what if you are told your registration didn\u2019t go through, or you don\u2019t have the required documents? Even if your registration is pending or your voter application has been wrongly purged, you are still allowed to vote.   Or, if you did forget your ID at home or have been removed from the registration system, you can cast a provisional ballot \u2013\u00a0a right all voters are entitled to by federal law.   Here\u2019s a handy tip sheet on steps to take if you\u2019re turned away from the polls:   Read more on what to do if you\u2019re told you can\u2019t vote here.   Democrats on the campaign trail are mostly doing their best to keep President Trump\u2019s name out of their conversations with voters.   Democrat candidates have been closing the campaign the same way they began it: By touting their opposition to Republican efforts to end the Affordable Care Act and condemning the Trump-backed tax bill Republicans passed late last year, while seeking to avoid being drawn into the muck by a President trying to gin up an immigration panic on Twitter and at rallies.   The issue rallying Democrats: From California to Indiana to New Jersey, Democrats discussed ways to expand and protect health care, while stiff-arming the President\u2019s rhetoric \u2013 a tactic that has largely ceded him the national media spotlight, but as many Democrats view it, allowed them to focus more on what voters in their districts wanted to talk about.   If Democrats win back a majority in the House, as leaders on both sides of the aisle now expect, the practice of snubbing Trump on the stump \u2013 in contrast to Republicans who largely stayed close to him \u2013 could change the way Democrats think about engaging with a President who has often seemed impervious their attacks. But if Democrats fail to turn the House blue, the strategy will largely be viewed as a failure, proving that Democrats still have not figured out how to message around Trump two years after his election.   Keep reading about the Democrats\u2019 efforts here.   There is a lot up for grabs Tuesday.   All 435 House races are on the ballot, with Democrats feeling optimistic about winning control of the chamber.   In the Senate, 35 seats are at stake, with Republicans positioned to hold \u2013 and possibly expand \u2013 the party\u2019s slim majority. And 36 gubernatorial contests will be decided, with Democrats looking to put a dent in the current 17-seat advantage for Republicans. That doesn\u2019t count the 6,066 state legislative races across 46 states and 158 ballot measures in 37 states.   With so much at stake, we here at CNN have identified 10 races that help explain the story of the 2018 midterms \u2013 and might offer hints about how things are likely to shake out on Election Night.   Click here to learn more about these races.   With one day to go before the midterm elections, Americans face a choice that could shape the nation for years after a campaign that left it politically torn, at war with itself over race, and mourning tragedy.   Voters must decide on Tuesday whether to constrain President Trump and his compliant Republicans after the first two years of a demagogic presidency that widened national divides and unfolded in a torrent of scandal. Trump also tested constitutional norms and engineered a sharp shift in the country\u2019s attitude toward the rest of the world.   What the polls say: Democrats continue to hold a double-digit lead over Republicans in a generic congressional ballot among likely voters, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. The party\u2019s 55% to 42% advantage in the new poll mirrors their lead in early October and is about the same as the 10-point edge they held just after Labor Day.   But as they face their first chance to judge Trump\u2019s performance, they could also register satisfaction with a historically primed economy and a President who has kept many of his election promises, however controversial, and is running an undeniably consequential administration that has managed to engineer a generational conservative shift to the Supreme Court.   The first result would represent a rebuke to Trump\u2019s entire political approach: His failure to tame his volatile instincts in the interests of national unity and his unwillingness to embrace the presidency itself as a national trust.   The second would convey acquiescence for the President\u2019s scorched-earth tactics, indefatigable and domineering personality, fear-mongering warnings that the nation is under assault from an invading immigrant tide of dark-skinned criminals and approval of his creed of \u201cAmerica First\u201d nationalism.   Keep reading Stephen Collinson\u2019s analysis.   As of this morning,\u00a0at least\u00a031,299,060\u00a0votes have been cast early or by mail nationwide, according to data collected by Catalist.   CNN is partnering with Catalist, a data company that works with Democrats and others, to compile counts of ballots cast before Election Day, either early in-person or by-mail.   Here\u2019s a breakdown of ballots cast in a few selected states \u2014 and how the numbers compare to 2016 and 2014:   On the eve of the midterm elections, Democrats continue to hold a double-digit lead over Republicans in a generic Congressional ballot among likely voters, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by\u00a0SSRS.   The party\u2019s 55% to 42% advantage in the new poll mirrors their lead in early October and is about the same as the 10-point edge they held just after Labor Day.   That\u2019s a slimmer edge than the party held in CNN\u2019s final poll before the 2006 midterm elections and similar to the Republicans\u2019 10-point advantage just before the 2010 midterms.   Here\u2019s a few key takeaways from the poll:   Check out the full poll results here.   President Donald Trump said Sunday that he used to be friends with Oprah Winfrey, who went to Georgia to campaign for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election.   Trump slammed Abrams on Sunday at a rally in Macon, Georgia, while campaigning for her opponent, Republican gubernatorial nominee and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp.   \u201cAnd she brought Oprah here to help her,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOprah was a friend of mine until I ran for office,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201conce I ran for office, we diverged slightly.\u201d   Trump said Winfrey \u201chas been down to Mar-a-Lago,\u201d and before he ran for\u00a0office, \u201cwe did very well, we had a good relationship, and I like Oprah.\u201d   Trump claimed in the last week of Oprah\u2019s show the media mogul interviewed \u201cher five most important people, I assume,\u201d and said at the rally he was one of those people. He has previously made this claim. But according to Oprah\u2019s website, Trump appeared on \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d in an episode that originally aired February 7, 2011, and the last episode of the show aired months later, on May 25, 2011.   \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to burn the tape,\u201d Trump said.   Trump also appeared on Oprah\u2019s show in 1988.   \u201cOprah was here to endorse Stacey and I\u2019m here to endorse Brian. And you know what? I hope you\u2019re going to listen to my endorsement.\u201d   As part of his closing argument, former Vice President Joe Biden said that Sunday this election is the most critical of voters lifetimes.   \u201cThis is so important for our kids. This is the most important election you\u2019ve ever been part of, no matter how old or how young you are. The very character of our nation is on the ballot Tuesday,\u201d Biden said in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he stumped for Gov. Tom Wolf and congressional candidate George Scott.   Touching on the rise of white supremacy and anti-Semitism, Biden called out President Donald Trump for placing a moral equivalence between the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year and those who opposed them.   \u201cWe are in a battle for America\u2019s soul,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhen hatred is given a chance to fester, it gives license for others to come out of the darkness. When this distorted worldview is fueled online, it spreads, ladies and gentlemen. And when the President of the United States of America assigns, as he did, a moral equivalence between those dark forces and those opposing them, that puts fuel on the fire of intolerance and legitimates people who should never be heard.   \u201cOur children are listening and they\u2019re watching. And our silence is complicity. Silence is complicity,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut folks, we will not be silent.\u201d   The former vice president said voters this cycle needed to do something different than they ever have during his career.   \u201cWe have to reset the moral compass of this nation,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Tuesday is about.\u201d   CNN\u2019s Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.   President Donald Trump claimed on Sunday that Georgia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams would take away all guns from the people of the state.   \u201cStacey and her friends will get rid of it,\u201d Trump said of the Second Amendment.   Abrams has not said she would want to abolish the Second Amendment. She has said, however, that she supports an assault weapons ban in Georgia.   In an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday morning, Abrams said she wanted \u201ccommon-sense gun safety legislation.\u201d   \u201cI am happy to work with the legislature to figure out how we make an assault weapons ban work,\u201d Abrams said.   Trump went on to claim, without evidence, that electing Abrams would turn the state of Georgia into the nation of Venezuela.   CNN\u2019s Sarah Westwood and Eli Watkins contributed to this report.   Speaking in Macon, Georgia, on Sunday afternoon, President Donald Trump continued to use the contentious confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh in an effort to rally voters to support Republican candidates.   He used the allegedly recanted claim of a little-known accuser to question the credibility of Kavanaugh\u2019s other accusers without mentioning them by name.   The allegation he referred to received little to no attention, unlike the allegation from Christine Blasey Ford, who appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions about her accusations of sexual assault against the judge. Kavanaugh has denied Ford\u2019s allegations.   \u201cA woman who accused then-Judge Kavanaugh of horrible, horrible crimes admitted that actually she never met Judge Kavanaugh or Brett Kavanaugh or Kavanaugh period. Never met him. Never saw him,\u201d Trump said of the little-known accuser on Sunday. \u201cIt\u00a0was a total lie. She made up the story, and she was forced to admit it.\u201d   The crowd then broke out in \u201clock her up\u201d chants.   Trump made similar remarks on Saturday at a Montana rally, dwelling extensively on Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation \u2014 and repeatedly misleading the crowd about the allegations against the judge, blaming Democrats for a \u201cfilthy, dirty lie.\u201d   The little-known case Trump has seized on came to light in a referral from Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, referred the accuser, Judy Munro-Leighton to the Justice Department and FBI for investigation for potentially making false statements and obstruction.\u00a0Grassley claimed that Munro-Leighton confessed to committee investigators that she had never met Kavanaugh and admitted her allegation was a \u201cploy\u201d and \u201ctactic\u201d because she opposed the judge\u2019s nomination.   CNN\u2019s Eli Watkins, Jeremy Diamond and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.   Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said on Sunday in response to a question about President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201ccaravan\u201d rhetoric that she believed he was seeking to divide the electorate.   \u201cWhat Donald Trump wants to do is see if he can turn us against each other,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe wants to see if he can stir up more fear.\u201d   Warren made her remarks to reporters in Worcester, Massachusetts, on the final Sunday before the midterm elections.   CNN\u2019s Eli Watkins and DJ Judd contributed to this report.   Florida Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum responded on Sunday to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue describing the stakes of the Florida governor\u2019s election next week as being \u201ccotton-pickin\u2019 important.\u201d   \u201cHe should go back to Georgia,\u201d Gillum told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of Florida. Listen we\u2019re trying our very best to end this race on a high note.\u201d   Perdue is the former GOP governor of Georgia and made the remark on Saturday while campaigning for Gillum\u2019s opponent, former GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis.   CNN\u2019s Daniella Diaz contributed to this report.   President Donald Trump left the White House on Sunday afternoon headed for events in Georgia and Tennessee, where he is looking to boost Georgia GOP Secretary of State Brian Kemp\u2019s gubernatorial bid and Tennessee GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who is vying to replace outgoing Republican Sen. Bob Corker.   Trump stopped to talk to reporters before he boarded Marine One and seemed to indicate that he felt better about his party\u2019s chances of retaining control of the Senate than the House.   \u201cI think we\u2019re going to do very well in the Senate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to do well in the House. The difference is I can\u2019t campaign with all of those House members. There\u2019s so many of them, but I can go out and help senators.\u201d   The latest from CNN\u2019s Harry Enten said Democrats \u201cremain modest \u2014 though not runaway \u2014 favorites to gain House control.\u201d   CNN\u2019s Liz Stark contributed to this report.   Former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 who has yet to say whether he\u2019ll mount a 2020 White House bid \u2014 has been a top Democratic Party campaign fixture around the country and on the airwaves this cycle.   According to his spokesman Bill Russo, Biden has recorded 56 direct-to-camera videos, 16 robocalls and 10 radio ads for the general elections coming to a close this Tuesday.   At least one robocall was for Abigail Spanberger in the Virginia 7th and one radio ad was for Rep. Cedric Richmond, who represents Louisiana\u2019s 2nd District.   CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski contributed to this report.   The Trump campaign announced on Sunday that President Donald Trump would campaign with \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d singer Lee Greenwood at a rally in Tennessee on Sunday and in Missouri on Monday evening.   During his rallies, Trump is almost always introduced to the song, and he begins speaking once the song finishes playing.   \u201cLee Greenwood\u2019s \u2018God Bless the USA\u2019 has been a fixture of our iconic Trump rallies and is beloved by millions of patriotic Americans,\u201d Trump campaign official Michael Glassner said in the announcement.   In a separate announcement on Sunday, the campaign said conservative commentators Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh would join Trump at the Cape Girardeau, Missouri, rally.   CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles contributed to this report.   On CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d Sunday morning, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said the forecast pointed to severe weather in key states around\u00a0the midterms, including the potential for tornados and damaging winds in Tennessee and Indiana on Monday and a push on east through Election Day.   Going ahead to Tuesday, she said southern states on the east coast have the potential for severe storms and even localized flooding in some instances on Election Day.   Watch Allison\u2019s report from this morning here.   President Donald Trump will hold a rally at 4 p.m. ET in Macon, Georgia, with  Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the Republican gubernatorial nominee.   Trump will then fly to Chattanooga, Tennessee, for a 7 p.m. ET rally with Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who is running for Senate.   The office of Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is also the Republican nominee for governor, said it is opening an investigation into the Georgia Democratic Party after what it calls a \u201cfailed attempt to hack the state\u2019s voter registration system.\u201d   The office said the hacking attempt was Saturday evening and did not offer any proof why it is investigating the state Democratic Party.   \u201cAfter a failed attempt to hack the state\u2019s voter registration system,\u00a0the Secretary of State\u2019s office\u00a0opened an investigation into the Democratic Party of Georgia on the evening of Saturday, November 3, 2018. Federal partners, including the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation, were immediately alerted,\u201d Candice Broce, press secretary for the Secretary of State, said in a statement Sunday morning.\u201cWhile we cannot comment on the specifics of an ongoing investigation, I can confirm that the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cyber crimes,\u201d Broce said. \u201cWe can also confirm that no personal data was breached and our system remains secure.\u201d     CNN has reached out to the state Democratic Party for reaction.   Stacey Abrams, Georgia\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial nominee, in a pre-tape with Jake Tapper for CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d reacted to the announcement:   \u201cI\u2019ve heard nothing about it and my reaction would be that this is a desperate attempt on the part of my opponent to distract people from the fact that two different federal judges found him derelict in his duties and have forced him to accept absentee ballots to be counted and those who are being held captive by the exact match system to be allowed to vote. He is desperate to turn the conversation away from his failures, from his refusal to honor his commitments and from the fact that he\u2019s part of a nationwide system of voter suppression that will not work in this election because we\u2019re going to outwork him, we\u2019re going to out vote him and we\u2019re going to win.\u201d     Adam Levy and Jason Hoffman contributed to this report   President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are in Pensacola, Florida, this Saturday night to rally for the Republican ticket just days ahead of the Midterms.   Trump was also in Montana earlier in the day for a rally.   The Justice Department on Saturday released details about its plans regarding election security concerns for Tuesday.   The DOJ\u2019s efforts will span across multiple divisions of the agency, including the Civil Rights Division, the Criminal Division and the National Security Division.   Here are some of the actions the DOJ said it will be taking on Election Day:   President Donald Trump has wrapped up his rally in Montana, and will now head to Pensacola, Florida \u2013 a traditionally Republican stronghold \u2013 for his second event of the day.   The rally, which is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET, will be his second trip to Florida in four days after spending Wednesday night in Fort Myers.   President Donald Trump referenced the group of migrants traveling through Mexico to the US border at a rally in Montana on Saturday.   \u201cThese people are vicious,\u201d President Trump said of the Honduran refugees in\u00a0Mexico. He called them \u201cvery tough, young people,\u201d adding they were \u201ccriminals in some cases. In many cases.\u201d     As proof, he cited those who threw rocks at police, and said,\u00a0\u201cMexico is trying. But I think maybe they can try a little bit harder.\u201d   \u201cBut we\u2019re different, we more than try.\u00a0We have our military now on the border,\u201d he said to applause.   He then noted \u201cbeautiful barbed wire\u201d presumably going up on the US-Mexico border.\u00a0\u201cI noticed all that beautiful barbed wire going up today. Barbed wire used properly can be a beautiful sight,\u201d he said.   He added that women voters want safe neighbors and \u201cthey want violent predators like we\u2019re talking about to be thrown in jail or thrown the hell out of our country and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d   President Donald Trump took aim at the Democratic Party\u2019s policies on illegal immigration, claiming that Democrats want to give illegal immigrants the right to vote in order to \u201cstay in office forever.\u201d   \u201cThe Democrat Party wants to sign illegal aliens up for free health care, free welfare, free education. And what do they really want? The right to vote. Because they figure that\u2019s the way they stay in office forever,\u201d Trump said.   The President later slammed Democrats who support getting rid of ICE and suggested people in Montana would be concerned about their safety if ICE is abolished.   \u201cThey want to get rid of ICE,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEven you in Montana, you\u2019re not going to be able to walk around. You\u2019ll be locking those doors, you\u2019ll be locking those windows.\u201d   At a rally in Montana, President Donald Trump slammed Democratic Sen. Jon Tester for opposing Dr. Ronny Jackson\u2019s nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.   \u201cHe might be a nice guy, except he tried to destroy Admiral Ronny Jackson, who is the most clean-cut, wonderful person that you ever met. He tried to destroy him,\u201d Trump said.\u201cAnd I\u2019ve never forgotten it. And it\u2019s honestly one of the reasons I\u2019ve been here so much,\u201d Trump added, as the Belgrade crowd cheered.     The President later questioned why Tester opposed Jackson\u2019s nomination: \u201cJon Tester tried to ruin him, in order, what? In order so that I\u2019d pick someone else to run the VA? What was the purpose of it?\u201d   \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a political threat,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cRonny didn\u2019t even really want to do it in retrospect. I feel guilty because I\u2019m the one that said you should do it, because I thought he\u2019d do a great job.\u201d   There is an ongoing Pentagon IG probe into allegations against Jackson.   President Donald Trump recognized that Democrats stick together well at his rally in Belgrade, Montana.   Of Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, Trump said, \u201cYou know, they\u2019re lousy politicians and they have lousy policy, but they stick together. one thing I\u2019ll say: they stick together. they really do, the Democrats.\u201d     He noted how they stuck together during the Kavanaugh \u201choax\u201d as well as the \u201cRussian hoax\u201d that cost Hillary Clinton the election.   He also took the opportunity to knock his former rival, saying she didn\u2019t lose because of Russia.   \u201cYou gotta go and you got to campaign in Wisconsin. You got to campaign harder in Pennsylvania. You got to campaign in Michigan. You got to campaign harder in North Carolina. You know? Not Russia,\u201d he said.   He continued, \u201cThey used that as an excuse for losing the electoral college,\u201d which he said is set up for Democrats to win.   \u201cBut you know what? Hopefully 2020 is gonna come along and we\u2019re going to do even better.\u201d   Rallying\u00a0supporters in Montana on Saturday at an\u00a0crisp airport rally outside Bozeman, President Donald Trump blasted Sen.\u00a0Jon Tester for opposing Kavanaugh.   \u201cIf crowds mean anything, we\u2019re going to have a great Tuesday \u2013 that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Trump said.     The President\u00a0dwelled extensively on Justice\u00a0Brett\u00a0Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation \u2014 and repeatedly\u00a0misled the crowd about the sexual misconduct allegations made against him, blaming Democrats for a \u201cfilthy, dirty lie.\u201d   He amplified the argument he made on Twitter earlier today,\u00a0not mentioning the name of Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers but suggesting all have recanted their stories, which isn\u2019t\u00a0true.   \u201cOne of his accusers just came out a little while ago and said it was all a lie and said she never met now Justice Kavanaugh.\u00a0It was a made up story. She made up the story. It was a lie. It was a total like. It was fake. You know what fake means? It was fake. She lied about the story about rape.\u00a0About rape, she lied And we\u2019re supposed to sit back and take it.\u201d   He did not draw a distinction between Christine\u00a0Ford and other women who made claims to the Senate Judiciary Committee.   Correction: A previous version incorrectly used the word \u201crecounted\u201d instead of \u201crecanted\u201d in a suggestion made by the President on Kavanaugh accusers.   President Donald Trump is in Big Sky Country this Saturday \u2013 making this his fourth trip to Montana since July.   And he\u2019s there to campaign against Sen. Jon Tester.   CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny reports that Trump is more invested in Montana\u2019s Senate contest than almost any other, and that the President has not forgiven Tester for raising questions that ultimately led to the embarrassing withdrawal of Dr. Ronny Jackson,\u00a0Trump\u2019s personal physician, as the nominee for secretary of veterans affairs.   This is the first of two rallies Trump will be speaking at on Saturday \u2013 later he\u2019ll head to Florida.   Former Vice President Joe Biden reacted to President Donald Trump recently saying he tries to tell the truth when he can.   \u201cDid you hear him trying to explain honesty?\u201d Biden asked in Parma Heights, Ohio. \u201cNo, no, no I\u2019m not joking. He was on the air saying well honesty is \u2014\u00a0they\u2019re trying to convince us that honesty is relative depending on where you stand. Truth is truth. Truth is truth. Honesty is honesty.\u201d     Biden was in Ohio for the second time this week campaigning for Sen. Sherrod Brown and the Democratic nominees for governor and lieutenant governor, Richard Cordray and Betty Sutton.   Biden still seems to be recovering from laryngitis, sounding even more hoarse than days before.\u00a0He joked about his raspy voice, saying he was trying to sound like Senator Sherrod Brown.   \u201cMy name\u2019s Joe Biden and I have been in 22 states with 60 candidates, 11 cities in the last 4 days. And the reason I\u2026tell you that is I wanted to get my voice so I could sound like Sherrod Brown,\u201d Biden said.   One of the moments where his voice is normally booming but instead sounded raspy and squeaky:   \u201cOrdinary people can do extraordinary things if given a chance. That\u2019s what built this country. Ordinary people.\u00a0Just give them half a chance to do it. We have to re-set the moral compass of this nation and we do that on Tuesday.\u201d   He seemed to save the most of his voice\u2019s energy for his closing argument.   \u201cWe Democrats have to make it clear who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose our allies over our enemies. And we choose truth over lies,\u201d he said.   President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama are both recording robocalls for their parties\u2019 candidates ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterms.   Trump recorded calls for the Republican Senate candidates in Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nevada, Tennessee and West Virginia through the Senate Leadership Fund,\u00a0per an aide to the group. He also recorded one for Martha McSally in Arizona via Defend Arizona, another GOP super PAC backing Martha McSally.   Trump also recorded calls for the Republican National Committee and some House GOP candidates. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for a full list of candidates for whom Trump recorded get-out-the-vote robocalls.   Obama, meanwhile, recorded calls for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, a county Democratic Party in Texas, Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and a slate of House candidates.   His office declined to provide a list of candidates and committees for whom the former president has recorded calls, but said Obama has recorded a total of more than 50 robocalls, digital spots and radio ads.   A white supremacist group that targeted Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum with racist robocalls is now targeting Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.   What is it? The prerecorded phone message features a voice impersonating Oprah Winfrey, who was in Georgia on Thursday stumping for Abrams, and contains racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric.   Abrams\u2019 Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, strongly denounced the automated call, calling it \u201cabsolutely disgusting\u201d in a statement Friday.   Here\u2019s what Abrams\u2019 director of strategic communication, Abigail Collazo, said in a statement on Saturday morning:   \u201cOver the last few weeks we\u2019ve seen increasing desperation from many dark corners trying to steal the election, cheat, lie, and prey on people\u2019s fears rather than having the respect to listen to voters and speak to their hopes,\u201d Collazo said. She added that it was \u201cpathetic\u201d that Kemp \u201chas only now suddenly decided to find a conscience as polls are tightening and Georgia voters are making it clear that they reject the kind of hate he and his allies have been spewing around the state. These automated calls are being sent into homes just days before President Trump arrives, reminding voters exactly who is promoting a political climate that celebrates this kind of vile, poisonous thinking.\u201d   Read more here.   Everything we know about midterm voters \u2013 including that there will be less of them and they\u2019ll hail more from the parties\u2019 bases than in a presidential cycle \u2013 means that the Trump factor will be on their minds at the polls.   \u201cBoth of these sides have been waiting for this moment since January 2017,\u201d professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University (and CNN contributor) Julian Zelizer told me about this year\u2019s midterm voters.   \u201cThese are people who have been encouraged or most aggravated by what\u2019s happening in the news.\u201d   Because of that, for campaigns this year (and increasingly over the last few cycles) it\u2019s less about how to win voters over, but how to get the ones you want to the polls. Case in point: Trump\u2019s hard pivot to the immigration issue in the last week of the election in an attempt to rile up Republican voters.   \u201cIt\u2019s clear he\u2019s trying to activate his base,\u201d UNI political science professor Chris Larimer told me this week.     But will that strategy activate his base, or encourage those who dislike him?   At least nationally, we have a picture of just how polarized voters are on Trump, thanks to polling from CNN and SSRS earlier this month. Among Democrats, 92% disapprove of Trump \u2013 while 87% of Republicans approve of the President.   In key states like Florida, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia on Election Day, the difference will ultimately come down to which side is bigger \u2013 and who makes it to the polls.   Saturday morning began on Friday night for Democrats.   Glued to their televisions and Twitter feeds, they watched as former President Barack Obama lambasted his successor for the second time in six hours at a rally for Stacey Abrams, the former state House minority leader running for governor in Georgia.   Obama, at Morehouse College in Atlanta, answered Trump\u2019s jab from earlier in the week, when the Republican President said Abrams \u2013 owner of an estimable political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2013 was \u201cnot qualified\u201d for the job that she and GOP Secretary of State Brian Kemp are at about even odds to win next week.   \u201cRepublicans \u2013 they keep trying to diminish Stacey\u2019s remarkable accomplishments,\u201d Obama said, without mentioning Trump by name.   \u201cShe is the most experienced, most qualified candidate in this race. She\u2019s got an incredible track record of fighting for working families.\u201d     As Obama divided his day by boosting the Democrats, first in Miami for gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Gillum and incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, and chopping away at Trump, Republicans eagerly returned the favor \u2014 and gave a preview of what to expect on Saturday. Trump\u2019s plans include campaigning for Senate challenger Matt Rosendale in Montana in the afternoon before returning to Florida for his second trip there in four days after spending Wednesday night in Fort Myers. This time he\u2019ll be in Pensacola, another traditionally Republican stronghold up in the state\u2019s Panhandle.   Trump then gave a howling hint of what to expect this weekend during a campaign stop in Indiana on Friday.   Keep reading.   President Trump emphasized the \u201cH\u201d in former President Barack Obama\u2019s full name as he criticized him during a rally in Indianapolis.   \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that Joe Donnelly is holding a rally this weekend with Barack\u00a0H.\u00a0Obama. Barack Obama,\u201d Trump said, prompting someone in the crowd to yell \u201cHe sucks!\u201d   Trump, who before running for office had raised birther conspiracy theories about Obama, did not elaborate on his reference to his predecessor\u2019s middle name.   He continued: \u201cI watched him speak today. He had a very small crowd, they don\u2019t talk about that. And they never talk about how big our crowds are.\u201d   Watch the moment:   President Trump attacked Democrats, pushed his immigration message, and touted a new jobs report at a rally in Indiana Friday.   Trump was in Indianapolis to campaign for Republican Mike Braun, who\u2019s running against Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly.   During his speech, Trump attacked what he called \u201cradical\u00a0Democrats,\u201d saying they would \u201ctake a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to our future.\u201d   He also seized on his immigration\u00a0message again, telling the crowd that\u00a0\u201cDemocrats want to invite caravan after caravan.\u201d   \u201cA blue wave would equal a crime wave, very simple,\u201d Trump said.   He added \u201ca red wave\u201d would mean jobs and prosperity.   Trump went on to hail the latest\u00a0jobs report. (The US economy added 250,000 jobs in October, significantly exceeding expectations. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%, a 49-year low.)   \u201cIn the last month alone, we added 250,000 jobs and another 650,000 Americans returned to the workforce,\u201d the President\u00a0said, adding \u201cWe have now the hottest economy in the world. When did you hear that last?\u00a0\u201d   First lady Melania Trump has decided not to hit the campaign trail alongside her husband, President Trump, as he spends the last days before Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections crisscrossing the country.   It\u2019s not unusual that this particular first lady has opted out of rallies and appearances with candidates and incumbents \u2013 she was not a regular presence during campaign events during the presidential campaign either. But it is worth noting that other Trump family members and Cabinet officials are acting as surrogates for the President as heated election battles are waged across the country.   \u201cDue to her schedule as a mother and as first lady, especially with the upcoming holidays and international travel, there are no plans for her to campaign,\u201d Trump\u2019s spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told CNN.     Her last major campaign appearance and speech was nearly two years ago, days before the November 2016 presidential election, when she made remarks in Pennsylvania.   Watch more:   There is a long line of people waiting to vote at the Ponce De Leon Library in Atlanta, Georgia, as Friday is the final day of early voting in the state.   Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp are vying to become the state\u2019s next governor. The heated contest has drawn even more attention this past week, after Oprah Winfrey campaigned for Abrams on Thursday.   Georgia in particular has seen a surge in early voters in comparison to previous election years. Although seniors above 65 still make up the largest early voting bloc in the state, the percentage of young early voters has jumped up.   As of Friday morning,\u00a0at least\u00a023,391,086\u00a0votes have been cast early or by mail nationwide, according to data collected by Catalist.   For those of you hoping the 2018 midterms will end on Election Day, I have some bad news: It\u2019s possible that we go into overtime.   I\u2019m not just talking recounts. I\u2019m talking about runoff elections in Georgia and Mississippi.   For example, let\u2019s look at Georgia.   Georgia state law requires that a candidate receives a majority of the vote in order to win. Right now, it\u2019s not clear that either Democrat Stacey Abrams or Republican Brian Kemp will reach the magical 50%+ on November 6.   Why? That\u2019s because Libertarian Ted Metz is also running.   When one averages all the polls taken in October and allocate the undecideds between Abrams and Kemp, Kemp leads with 49.3% to Abrams 48.3% to Metz\u2019s 2.3%. In other words, if the polls were right on (and they probably won\u2019t be), Kemp and Abrams would face each other in a runoff on December 4.   It would be tempting to assume that Kemp would be a favorite for that runoff. Not only would he have earned the most votes in the general election, he\u2019d be likely to pick up more of Metz\u2019s votes than Abrams would.   Additionally, runoffs in Georgia have not been kind to Democrats over the last 26 years.   Keep reading Harry Enten\u2019s The Forecast   Ivanka Trump traveled to Nevada and Iowa Thursday to support the candidacies of\u00a0Sen. Dean Heller and Gov. Kim Reynolds. On Friday, she\u00a0posted a message\u00a0on both Instagram and Twitter with a directive to her followers: \u201cVOTE for Reynolds!\u201d   Did the first daughter\u00a0and senior adviser to the President violate the Hatch Act? In short, not really.   So, what is the Hatch Act? The 1939 law\u00a0is supposed to stop the federal government from affecting elections or going about its activities in a partisan manner, and according to the Office of Special Counsel\u2019s own explanation of the rule, it applies to federal employees as well as state and local employees who work with federally funded programs.   Trump was traveling in her \u201cpersonal capacity,\u201d a White House official said.   \u201cIn the final stretch of the midterms Ivanka went in her personal capacity to support candidates she has built a personal relationship with: Nevada for Heller and Iowa for Reynolds. The events were a big success,\u201d the official said.   As for the social media posts, ethics expert Walter Shaub told CNN she is mostly in the clear. Both her Instagram and Twitter biographies contain the disclaimer, \u201cPersonal page.\u201d   \u201cOn balance, she\u2019s probably okay because she\u2019s emphasizing on the Twitter page that the views are her own and it\u2019s her personal page,\u201d Shaub said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0not perfect. I would love to see her delete any reference to her title (adviser to the President).\u201d  As the FIRST female Governor of Iowa, @IAGovernor cut taxes, balanced the budget (with a 127 m surplus!) & fostered a pro-growth environment where incomes are rising & unemployment is 2nd lowest in the Country!Proud to be in Des Moines to support my friend. Vote for Reynolds! https://t.co/dl3Li24Vs4  Shaub notes that it\u2019s clear that, unlike Kellyanne Conway, who has been found to be in violation of the Hatch Act twice, Trump posts a lot of content unrelated to her work.   If somebody were to file a complaint, Shaub said,\u00a0the OSC would receive the complaint. If they concluded\u00a0there was a violation, Trump would have an opportunity to respond, then they would make a decision and issue a report.   Only the President can take disciplinary action for a Hatch Act violation, and so far in the Trump administration, which has found five violations (two for Conway, one for Stephanie Grisham, one for Dan Scavino, and one for Nikki Haley), the White House has \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d the findings. The special counsel is a Trump appointee who comes from a conservative watchdog group.   President Trump griped about his predecessor\u2019s campaign appearance on Friday, saying he watched former President Barack Obama\u2019s speech while jetting to West Virginia for his own speech.   \u201cI listened to President Obama speak today. He had a very small crowd,\u201d Trump said in his remarks. \u201cI had to listen, I was in the plane, I had nothing else to do.\u201d   Trump said Obama\u2019s remarks about honesty and truthfulness rang hollow, citing the former president\u2019s vow to allow Americans to retain their preferred health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.   \u201cTwenty-eight times he said, \u2018You can keep your doctor if you like your doctor, you can keep your plan if you like your plan,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were all lies.\u201d   He lambasted Obama for saying he should respect the news media.   \u201cNobody was worse to the press\u00a0than Obama,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe even used, as I remember, the Justice Department to go after reporters.\u201d   \u201cHe was talking about how I should be nice to the Fake News,\u201d Trump went on. \u201cNo thank you.\u201d   Trump, in some of the most cutting words about his predecessor while in office, said Obama\u2019s record was nothing to be proud of.   \u201cLie after lie, broken promise after broken promise,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what he did.\u201d   President Trump addressed an incendiary campaign video for the first time Friday, defending his move to tweet the ad as \u201cjust telling the truth.\u201d   \u201cThey gave me a hard time because I put it up on Twitter and they gave a hard time,\u201d Trump told a crowd in Huntington, West Virginia. \u201cThey said, \u2018you shouldn\u2019t be doing that! That\u2019s not nice!\u2019\u201d   \u201cAnd I say, all I\u2019m doing is just telling the truth, what can I say,\u201d he added.   Decrying the migrant caravan, Trump suggested an interview in the ad occurred this week and that the person depicted was in the current caravan coming toward the United States.   \u201cI don\u2019t know if you saw the one, they interviewed him yesterday,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd he was asking for a pardon and didn\u2019t speak English. And the nice young I guess reporter was asking, \u201cOh, you want a pardon?\u201d   \u201cAnd what was it for?\u201d Trump asked the crowd. \u201cAnd essentially it was for murder, and he\u2019s in the caravan.\u201d   Why this matters: The video, tweeted by Trump on Wednesday afternoon, shows Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican man convicted in February of the 2014 slaying of two California deputies, declaring in court that he wanted to kill more cops, while text overlaid on the screen says, \u201cDemocrats let him into our country\u201d and \u201cDemocrats let him stay.\u201d A review of his case, however, shows multiple interactions with both local and federal officials during Republican and Democratic administrations, as well as noted anti-immigration firebrand Joe Arpaio, former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona.   The video has been denounced by Democrats and some Republicans as racist for comparing Bracamontes with the caravans of migrants heading toward the US from Central America. But beyond the attempt to taint a group of people with the horrific actions of one, the details of Bracamontes\u2019 story also show it\u2019s simply false to blame Democrats for his entrance into the US.   Commentators also likened the ad to the Willie Horton ad in the 1988 campaign. That ad was backed by supporters of George H.W. Bush\u2019s presidential campaign. It depicted Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis as responsible for the rape Horton, a convicted murderer, committed while out of prison while furloughed under a Massachusetts program. The ad was seen as playing into white fear and racist stereotypes of African-Americans.   President Trump\u00a0acknowledged at a rally in West Virginia on Friday that Republicans losing the House \u201ccould happen.\u201d   Trump, promising dire consequences of a Democratic takeover,\u00a0acknowledged such a scenario could come to fruition.   \u201cIt will be ridiculous frankly. It will be bad for our country,\u201d he said.   The President continued: \u201cAnd it could happen. We\u2019re doing very well. And we\u2019re doing really well in the Senate. And you know what you do \u2014 my whole life, you know what I say \u2014 don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll just figure it out.\u201d   Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts campaigned Friday morning for Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is running for re-election.   Warren attended the \u201cWomen for Tammy Rally\u201d in Madison, Wisconsin, to encourage early voting. Following the rally, attendees will head over to the City County Building to early vote.   Baldwin has enjoyed support from other prominent politicians, including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former President Barack Obama.   According to recent polls, she is forecasted to win by 12 points. A\u00a0Marquette Law School poll\u00a0in September found 48% of likely voters in Wisconsin have a favorable view of Baldwin, compared with 40% unfavorable.   Baldwin\u2019s opponent, state Sen. Leah Vukmir, won a hotly-contested GOP primary in August that drained valuable resources to compete with Baldwin, who despite the flood of early spending entered the general election with an overwhelming financial advantage.   Former President Barack Obama attacked the Republican leadership for their divisive rhetoric, number of indictments, and \u201cconstant fear-mongering.\u201d   Obama, speaking at a Miami rally Friday, highlighted the accomplishments of the Democratic party and his presidency, quipping, \u201cRight now, Republicans are all, \u2018Look, the economy is so good.\u2019 Where do you think that started?\u201d   \u201cNow Republicans have been in control for two years\u2026 What have they done with that power?\u201d he asked, to which the crowd roared back, \u201cNothing!\u201d   \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he replied. \u201cThey cut taxes for the rich, just like they did the last time. They stripped out rules to protect our air and water. They ran up the deficit, just like the last time.\u201d   Obama also criticized Republicans for drumming up fear over \u201ca bunch of poor\u00a0refugees a thousand miles away,\u201d adding that they were \u201cblatantly, repeatedly,\u00a0boldly, shamelessly lying.\u201d   \u201cWhen words stop meaning\u00a0anything, when truth doesn\u2019t\u00a0matter, when people can just\u00a0lie with abandon, democracy\u00a0can\u2019t work,\u201d he said to the cheering crowd.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s happening at\u00a0the highest levels.\u00a0And the only check on that\u00a0behavior is you.\u00a0The only check on that behavior\u00a0is you and your vote.\u201d   Watch it here:   Former President Barack Obama campaigned for Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the Democrat running for governor, and incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, who\u2019s facing a tough re-election campaign, at a rally in Florida on Friday.   \u201cThe real reason I came down to Miami is cause this Tuesday might be the most important election of our lifetimes,\u201d Obama said. \u201cPoliticians will always say that, but this time it\u2019s actually true. The stakes really are that high. The consequences of any of us staying home really are more dangerous, because America is at a crossroads.\u201d   He decried political rhetoric \u201cdesigned to make us angry and made us fearful\u2026 to make us believe that  order will somehow be restored if it just weren\u2019t for those folks who don\u2019t look like we look, or love like we love, or pray like we do.\u201d   His speech was occasionally interrupted by hecklers, to which the crowd responded by chanting \u201cObama\u201d and \u201cBring it home.\u201d   He dismissed the heckling as \u201can old playbook,\u201d and \u201cas cynical as politics gets.\u201d   \u201cIn four days, Florida, you can reject that kind of politics,\u201d he said to the cheering crowd.   Gillum and Nelson also spoke before the packed audience, touching on issues including climate change, criminal justice reform, and healthcare.   Watch more:   In a defeat for Georgia Secretary of State and Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, a federal judge ruled Friday that 3,141 recently naturalized US citizens whose voter registrations were placed on hold must be allowed to vote Tuesday.   The naturalized citizens\u2019 voter applications were originally held up by Georgia\u2019s \u201cexact match,\u201d apparently because their new citizenship status was not yet updated in Georgia\u2019s driver database. Voting rights activists say many of them are minority voters.   Kristen Clark, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which brought the lawsuit, said, \u201cThis eliminates the unfair burdens that those voters would have faced on Election Day.\u201d   \u201cThese voters could have lost the right to vote. They never should have been burdened like this in the first place,\u201d she added.     She explained that people who recently became citizens were particularly burdened by the state\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d policy, because those in pending status would have had to find deputy registrars on Election Day and provide proof of citizenship to vote.   \u201cIt\u2019s often impossible to find those officials on Election Day,\u201d Clark said.   Read the court order here:   GOP senate candidate Mitt Romney published a blog post on Thursday that pushes back on President Trump\u2019s rhetoric against the media,\u00a0writing he cannot \u201cconceive of thinking or saying\u201d that the media is an enemy.   Romney references Trump\u2019s tweet earlier this week that said there is \u201cgreat anger\u201d in America caused by the \u201cfake news media, the true enemy of the people.\u201d   \u201cSurely every president has endured stories that he knew were inaccurate and has chaffed at one or more news publications\u2026. But no American president has ever before vilified the American press or one of its professional outlets as an \u201cEnemy of the People,\u201d Romney writes, adding that he sometimes gets \u201cirritated\u201d by stories he knows are wrong.   He argues that, \u201c \u2026 denigrating the media diminishes an institution that is critical to democracy, both here and abroad. As a political tactic, it may be brilliant, but it comes with a large cost to the cause of freedom.\u201d     On the campaign trail: Romney says he was asked at a recent campaign event if he would \u201ctake action to shut down ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN and the New York Times.\u201d   \u201cWhen I responded \u2018of course not,\u2019 and that, in fact, I would do everything in my power to preserve freedom of speech, the person persisted by arguing that these outlets purvey fake news. I found this deeply disturbing,\u201d Romney writes.   More than three hours before former President Barack Obama was scheduled to speak at a rally, thousands of supporters wrapped around the Ice Palace Film Studios in Miami.   Obama is campaigning for Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the Democrat running for governor, and incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, who\u2019s facing a tough re-election campaign.   Take a look at the lines:  Bit humid but there\u2019s a crowd out to see Obama and Gillum here today in Miami pic.twitter.com/7kAZ8IVfrR  With just days to the midterm elections, Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Friday morning calling on the billionaire to address \u201cloopholes\u201d in Facebook\u2019s political ad system.   Political ads on the platform are supposed to say who paid for them, but multiple news organizations in the past few weeks have shown there are easy ways for advertisers to mask their identities.   Vice News, posing as a political ad-buyer, got approval from Facebook to run ads in the name of every single one of the US\u2019 100 senators.\u00a0ProPublica reported\u00a0on Thursday it had identified issues with how private interest groups use the Facebook disclaimer.   Separately, CNN Business found an advertiser breaking Facebook\u2019s rules twice in one week. Facebook missed both violations and only acted in both instances after CNN inquired about it.   In their letter, the senators wrote, \u201cThe fact that Facebook\u2019s new security tools allow users to intentionally misidentify who placed political ads is unacceptable. That Facebook is unable to recognize ads connected to a well-established foreign interference operation is also deeply troubling.\u201d   \u201cYour company is currently failing to carry out the basic disclosure and disclaimer provisions of the legislation,\u201d the letter concluded. \u201cWe strongly urge you to take every step necessary to close these loopholes in the transparency tool.\u201d   As both sides muster their resources in the final days leading up to the midterms, CNN looked at the TV shows that have aired the most political ads in 2018 as of October 30, how much was spent to air them, and who aired the most.   The top buyers were all either the Republican PAC Congressional Leadership Fund, the Democratic group Senate Majority PAC, or Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat whom President Trump has campaigned to replace with Republican Matt Rosendale and who was able to air more ads on top shows for a much lower rate in Montana.

The attempts were all \u201cquickly prevented or mitigated,\u201d she said, and the few that did succeed to gain access have not been attributed to a foreign country.\u00a0\u00a0She quickly said people could be trying to access personal information such as social security numbers, which isn\u2019t necessarily related to the elections.   \u201cIf you talk to a bank or you talk to somebody in the energy infrastructure,\u00a0we are under constant attack,\u201d Nielsen said.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t stress that enough.\u201d     \u201cWhat would be strange is if we didn\u2019t see any attempts\u2026 So as of today, we do not have any activity\u00a0that we\u2019re attributing on the election infrastructure to a foreign entity.\u201d   Former President Barack Obama will campaign for Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in Miami on Friday afternoon, at a rally also featuring incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, before heading a few hours north to Atlanta to meet up with former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams.   Gillum could become Florida\u2019s first African-American governor with a victory next week. Abrams\u2019 election would make her the first ever female African-American governor in the country.   Democrats are hoping Obama\u2019s blessing can put Gillum over the top in a race he has led narrowly, but consistently, in polling since scoring an upset primary win in late August. It\u2019s also a deeply pragmatic exercise, with early voting underway and at least one polling place about a mile from the event.   Former Florida state Sen. Dwight Bullard, now the political director of New Florida Majority, described Obama\u2019s visit as a \u201cpassing of the baton moment\u201d that could excite a few remaining skeptical Democrats while potentially enticing some left-leaning independents to turn out for Gillum.   \u201cAs a registered Democrat and someone who\u2019s been involved in Democratic politics, unfortunately, our party sometimes requires extra senses of reassurance. Otherwise people will ask, \u2018Why didn\u2019t this happen?\u2019 or \u2018Why didn\u2019t this person come down?\u2019\u201d Bullard said.   \u201cSo this is the cherry on the top moment that really sends a clear message to those Obama voters from 2008 and 2012 \u2013 that helped to win Florida \u2013 that now it\u2019s time to come out, mobilize and be a part of history.\u201d     Read more.   The US economy added a higher-than-expected 250,000 jobs in October, and the unemployment rate held at 3.7%, the government announced Friday.   What this means for the midterms: The strong jobs number gives\u00a0President Trump a boost heading into the last weekend of the midterm campaign, shoring up Trump\u2019s economic message after a month of market turmoil that has mostly erased gains for the year for the major indices.   At a White House event promoting workforce training earlier this week, Trump touted the fact that for several months job openings have\u00a0exceeded the number of people looking for work\u00a0for the first time since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started tracking openings in 2000.   \u201cYou didn\u2019t have a choice just a few years ago, and now you have a choice,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe actually need workers now. That\u2019s a good thing to be saying.\u201d     As of this morning,\u00a0at least\u00a025,859,552\u00a0votes have been cast early or by mail nationwide, according to data collected by Catalist.   CNN is partnering with Catalist, a data company that works with Democrats and others, to compile counts of ballots cast before Election Day, either early in-person or by-mail. The data is being provided each weekday morning.   Here\u2019s a breakdown of voting in seven key states \u2014 and how the numbers compare to 2016 and 2014.   Former President George H.W. Bush is one of thousands of Americans voting early this week ahead of Election Day.   The former president voted on Thursday with \u201chis two best friends\u201d \u2014 Jim Baker and his service dog Sully, Bush\u2019s spokesperson Jim McGrath tweeted.   McGrath shared of this photo of Bush and his two friends at the voting booth:  The 41st President accompanied by his two best friends -- Jim Baker and Sully -- discharging his civic duty and voting today. pic.twitter.com/1sSvkmWMQQ  Ivanka Trump is making a surprise appearance tonight in Iowa to campaign with Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who is locked in a tight contest with Democratic challenger Fred Hubbell.   Reynolds and Trump are no strangers \u2014 they banded together before on workforce development initiatives.   But this get-together has much higher stakes.   Reynolds, who became the Hawkeye State\u2019s chief executive after Terry Branstad left to become President Trump\u2019s ambassador to China in 2017, trails Hubbell in the most recent polling and is currently under fire for having far-right Republican Rep. Steve King (who has some election worries of his own) as the co-chair of her campaign. That, plus some longstanding issues like Iowa\u2019s messy \u2014 and seemingly failed \u2014 decision to privatize Medicaid, which Branstad did in 2016, has put Reynolds in an even deeper hole in an election cycle where Democrats have relentlessly hammered the GOP over health care issues.   Reynolds\u2019 campaign manager tweeted this photo from tonight\u2019s event:  Packed house at @KimReynoldsIA HQ to see @IvankaTrump! #KeepIowaMoving pic.twitter.com/vDsWvAO6PY  Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton\u2019s name came up tonight\u00a0at President Trump\u2019s rally in Missouri.   But it was Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley who raised Clinton\u2019s name \u2014 again and again \u2014 trying to tie Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill to the two-time presidential candidate.   \u201cWhen I look at Sen. McCaskill\u2019s record, I have to say it reminds me of another career politician that you recently defeated,\u201d Hawley said.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt reminds me of the person Claire thinks should be president \u2014 Hillary Clinton.\u201d   The crowd quickly broke into chants of \u201clock her up.\u201d   \u201cClaire McCaskill wanted us to call Hillary Clinton madam president,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cOn Nov. 6, we\u2019re going to call Claire McCaskill fired.\u201d   The President stood at Hawley\u2019s side and smiled. He didn\u2019t weigh in on Clinton, perhaps following his own words from earlier in the evening, when he declared: \u201cWe\u2019re being so nice.\u201d   But the President zeroed in on McCaskill again and again, far more than he does for many candidates he is campaigning against. He attacked McCaskill on immigration and\u00a0her vote against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.   This message will play again on Monday, when Trump returns to Missouri for his final campaign rally of the 2018 cycle.   President Trump delved into differences between the Republican and Democratic parties in Columbia, Missouri, five days before the midterm elections.   Trump, speaking at his rally Thursday, painted the Republicans as the party of \u201cnice.\u201d   \u201cThe Republican agenda is the mainstream agenda of the American people,\u201d the President said, adding that the Democratic agenda represents \u201cthe extreme far left.\u201d   Republicans, he said, are \u201cmuch tougher,\u201d \u201cmuch smarter,\u201d and \u201cmuch more sane.\u201d   \u201cWe welcome citizens from all walks of life and embrace freedom of thought, freedom of speech and freedom of everything else,\u201d he said   Democrats, he said, are the \u201cparty of conformity.\u201d   Alluding to protests of Republican officials and lawmakers at restaurants in the greater DC area, Trump said that Republicans are being \u201cso nice.\u201d   \u201cCan\u2019t have dinner, do you see what they\u2019re doing to our people? Do you see what they\u2019re doing to people\u00a0who represent our thought? We are being so nice. We\u2019re being so nice. And let\u2019s stay being nice, we\u2019ll stay being nice \u2018cause we are tough as hell. We\u2019re gonna stay being nice,\u201d the President said.   President Trump kicked off his Columbia\u00a0rally Thursday night with a scripted\u00a0message catered\u00a0to Missouri voters.   \u201cIn just five\u00a0days,\u00a0the people\u00a0of Missouri are going to retire far left Democrat Claire McCaskill,\u201d he said, noting that the Missouri senator \u201chas been saying such nice things about me.\u201d   Despite her kind words, Trump said, \u201cshe\u2019ll never vote\u201d with Republicans.   \u201cNever has and she didn\u2019t even vote for Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh, think of that,\u201d he said.   The President called on the crowd in the\u00a0airplane hangar to send her opponent,\u00a0\u201cMissouri patriot\u201d Josh Hawley, to the Senate.   \u201cJosh shares your values and he will fight for your values all the time so I need everyone to show up and vote, you gotta vote for Josh. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, other than the fact I like you very much and I\u2019m actually coming back on Monday,\u201d Trump said.   President Trump is delivering remarks at a Make America Great Again rally in Columbia, Missouri, this evening. It\u2019s the first of two rallies in the state in the next few days.   He is campaigning for\u00a0state Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican who is taking on Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.   CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly noted that the Trump\u2019s campaign blitz is focused on Senate races in eight states \u2014 Florida, Missouri, West Virginia, Indiana, Montana, Georgia, Tennessee and Ohio.   Why this matters: The President has a high approval rating in those states, Mattingly reported. He also won those states in the 2016 presidential election.   Watch more:   This midterm cycle appears\u00a0supercharged by younger voters, many of whom are voting early. In Texas and Georgia in particular, the share of younger early voters far outpaces anything seen at this point during the last midterm election, in 2014.   In the Texas Senate race, Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke is trying to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. In Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp are vying to become the state\u2019s next governor.   In several states the vote count is approaching what it did during the 2016 presidential election \u2013 which is notable because generally fewer people vote in midterm elections than presidential ones. That could either represent greater interest in the election or be part of a steady trend toward more Americans choosing to cast their votes early. Or both.   Here\u2019s what we know about early voters in Texas and Georgia:   Florida voters are almost evenly split on both Senate and gubernatorial contests, while the Senate contest in Tennessee appears to be shifting in the Republican\u2019s favor, according to a new CNN poll released Thursday.   Here\u2019s a breakdown of the Senate and gubernatorial races in both states:   Florida:   Tennessee:   Oprah isn\u2019t the only celebrity lending her support to Democratic gubernatorial Stacey Abrams.   Actor Mark Ruffalo tweeted his support for Abrams Thursday afternoon, declaring, \u201cI\u2019m proud to be on #TeamAbrams.\u201d  A #vote for @staceyabrams for governor is a vote for:\u2705 Protecting the environment\u2705 Common sense gun laws\u2705 Standing with the LGBTQ+ community\u2705 Fair voter laws\u2705 A better world (and so much more)I'm proud to be on #TeamAbrams.  https://t.co/uEeUIN9iKG pic.twitter.com/tSx0CStRGT  Singer John Legend, who\u00a0spoke at one of Abrams\u2019 rallies in early October, tweeted on Thursday that Abrams\u2019 Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, \u201cdoesn\u2019t deserve to be dog catcher in Georgia.\u201d   Actress and singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e also tweeted on Thursday: \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of the abuser of power Brian Kemp and stay on the right side of history and elect #StaceyAbrams.\u201d   Other celebrities who have shown support for Abrams include singer Kelly Rowland, rappers Ludacris and Common, and actors Tiffany Haddish and Will Ferrell.  This election is so crucial! Please get out and vote. Local and state government elections make a HUGE difference. (@staceyabrams) pic.twitter.com/xM55gqNA0A  Kemp also enjoys support from some powerful names, though they come more from the world of politics than the realm of popular culture.   Donald Trump Jr. campaigned for Kemp earlier in October, and Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in Georgia today, where he said that Abrams was \u201cbeing bankrolled by Hollywood liberals.\u201d   President Trump has also endorsed Kemp, and is expected to address the gubernatorial race during his Sunday rally in Macon, Georgia.   President Trump on Thursday announced a plan to change US asylum rules, as part of his closing argument to voters ahead of the midterms.   Trump did not release details on the asylum proposal or how it would be implemented. According to a White House aide, the administration will seek to require migrants to request asylum at legal points of entry, and prevent them from claiming asylum if they are caught crossing the border illegally. The President said he would sign an immigration-related executive order next week, but was not specific as to what it would address.   Trump has focused increasingly on immigration heading into the final days of the midterms, as Republicans across the country struggle to match their opponents in drumming up voter enthusiasm.   The announcement also comes a day after the President tweeted a racist ad produced for the Trump campaign. The web video features Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican man who had previously been deported but returned to the United States and was convicted in February in the slaying of two California deputies.   The ad recalls the notorious \u201cWillie Horton\u201d campaign ad financed by supporters of the George H.W. Bush campaign in the 1988 presidential election. Horton was a convicted murderer who committed rape while furloughed under a program in Massachusetts where Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis was governor.   The ad has since come to be seen as one of the most racially problematic in modern political history since it played into white fear and African-American stereotypes. It was regarded at the time as devastating to the Dukakis campaign.   CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper did a quick fact check after Trump\u2019s speech. For example, Trump said there were about 20 million undocumented immigrants in the US (his own administration says there are only 12 million).   Watch more from Tapper\u2019s fact check:   Oprah Winfrey is canvassing door-to-door in Georgia today, hoping to drum up votes for Democratic gubernatorial Stacey Abrams.   Winfrey, armed with a clipboard, surprised at least one Georgia woman while canvassing for Abrams. The woman appeared to be stunned to find Winfrey standing at her front door. She told Winfrey that she was voting for Abrams.   Watch her reaction:  A post shared by Oprah (@oprah)  Winfrey also stopped this woman whom she spotted holding a sign in a Georgia neighborhood:  A post shared by Oprah (@oprah)  Media mogul Oprah Winfrey and Vice President Mike Pence are both in Georgia today, campaigning for different gubernatorial candidates.   As Winfrey delivered an impassioned speech at a rally for Democrat Stacey Abrams, Pence reminded supporters of Republican Brian Kemp that he\u2019s \u201ckind of a big deal, too.\u201d   \u201cBrian Kemp\u2019s getting the support of all kinds of hard-working, good people all across Georgia, and Stacey Abrams is being bankrolled by Hollywood liberals,\u201d Pence said. \u201cSome of them come into the state. Like, I heard Oprah\u2019s in town\u00a0today.\u201d   The Vice President said he had a message for Abrams and her famous supporters.   \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0kind of a big deal, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThis ain\u2019t Hollywood.\u00a0This is Georgia.\u201d   Watch more:   Oprah Winfrey is in Georgia today, where she is campaigning for Democratic gubernatorial candidate\u00a0Stacey Abrams.   \u201cI\u2019m here today because Stacey\u00a0Abrams cares about the things\u00a0that matter,\u201d Winfrey said.   The media mogul said she didn\u2019t even know Abrams \u2014 she had to get the candidate\u2019s phone number from someone else \u2014 when she called her three days ago and told her she wanted to go to Georgia to \u201clend my support.\u201d   Here\u2019s what Winfrey said she told Abrams:   \u201cI told her, here\u2019s why I want to\u00a0come, Stacey:\u00a0Because I have been reading\u00a0about you.\u00a0I have been reading about you in\u00a0the Atlanta Journal. I\u2019ve been reading about you in Time\u00a0magazine. I\u2019ve been reading about you in the New York\u00a0Times.\u00a0And I have been watching you, and I\u00a0have been seeing how you handle\u00a0yourself.\u00a0I have been watching you in the\u00a0midst of the onslaught of\u00a0haters.\u00a0And vitriol that is thrown\u00a0against you.\u00a0I have been watching you and you\u00a0just keep coming \u2026\u00a0And not only do you keep\u00a0coming on, you keep standing\u00a0strong for the values that\u00a0matter to me and the values that\u00a0matter to Georgians all over\u00a0this state.\u201d   Later, she added: \u201cI\u2019m here today because of Stacey Abrams \u2026 I\u2019m here today because of the men and the women who were lynched, who were humiliated who were discriminated against , who were suppressed, who were repressed, who were oppressed for the right, for the equality at the polls.\u201d   Winfrey also insisted that today was about Abrams \u2014 and not about her own possible candidacy.   \u201cI\u2019m not here because I\u2019m making\u00a0some grandstand because I\u2019m thinking\u00a0about running myself.\u00a0I don\u2019t want to run, okay?\u201d she said.   Watch more:   Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, is campaigning for candidates in Ohio today. She\u2019s stumping for\u00a0join Rich Cordray, who is running for governor, and Betty Sutton, who is running for lieutenant governor.   \u201cI\u2019m here today here in Ohio. I\u2019m here to stand with Rich and Betty because it\u2019s our time to fight back. Are you ready to fight back?\u201d Warren asked at a rally this morning.     In her speech, Warren criticized Republicans in Washington.   \u201cI just want to talk to you just a minute about what\u2019s going on \u2013 what\u2019s going on right in now in Washington. I\u2019ve been there now, unbelievably to me, six years. I stood on the floor of the United States Senate when health care for tens of millions of Americans hung by a single vote. When the Republicans lined up to take away protection for people with pre-existing conditions \u2026. \u00a0I was on the floor of the United States Senate when the Republicans, having taken millions and millions of dollars from the oil industry \u2014 one of them stands up and declares again, climate change is a hoax. That\u2019s what we see day after day.\u201d   There\u2019s just five days left before election day, and politicians and elected officials are hitting the campaign trails to stump for candidates.   So is Oprah.   Here\u2019s a breakdown of who is campaigning where today:   As of this morning,\u00a0at least\u00a023,391,086\u00a0votes have been cast early or by mail nationwide, according to data collected by Catalist.   CNN is partnering with Catalist, a data company that works with Democrats and others, to compile counts of ballots cast before Election Day, either early in-person or by-mail.   Here\u2019s a breakdown of ballots cast in seven key states \u2014 and how the numbers compare to 2016 and 2014:   A man at last night\u2019s Trump rally in Fort Myers, Florida, approached CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta to apologize for once giving him the finger.   \u201cI just wanted to apologize for flipping you off in Tampa. I got carried away,\u201d he said. \u201cI was asking for facts and not opinions.\u201d     The man, who was wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, continued: \u201cBut I did get carried away, so I just wanted to apologize for that.\u201d   The man did not specify when the Tampa incident took place. Acosta was heavily heckled at a July rally in Tampa, with Trump supporters chanting \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cgo home\u201d behind him as he reported.   Acosta thanked him and said he accepted the apology.   Watch the moment here:  Had a hell of a night in Fort Myers. This man apologized for giving me the finger at a rally earlier this year in Tampa. Really. We had a moment. pic.twitter.com/Kfm0J0TbsC  Here\u2019s something scary: Even if you have the legal right to vote and have done everything to prepare yourself for Election Day, you could still be turned away at the polls.   In recent years, almost two dozen US states have implemented laws that impose new restrictions on voting,\u00a0which critics say disproportionally affect minority voters.   So, what if you are told your registration didn\u2019t go through, or you don\u2019t have the required documents? Even if your registration is pending or your voter application has been wrongly purged, you are still allowed to vote.   Or, if you did forget your ID at home or have been removed from the registration system, you can cast a provisional ballot \u2013\u00a0a right all voters are entitled to by federal law.   Here\u2019s a handy tip sheet on steps to take if you\u2019re turned away from the polls:   Read more on what to do if you\u2019re told you can\u2019t vote here.   Typical midterm elections tend to draw out an older, whiter electorate and fewer single women than presidential years.   But because of the deep disdain for Trump among the younger generation, this midterm cycle appears supercharged by younger voters who were stung by the outcome in 2016, and cognizant that their generation could have made the difference for Hillary Clinton.   The bottom line? Strong turnout within that age group could tip some of the closer House races into the Democratic column.   A\u00a0new poll from Harvard Institute of Politics\u00a0this week found that 18-to-29-year-olds are far more likely to vote in Tuesday\u2019s midterm election than they were in 2010 and 2014. Forty percent of those polled said they would \u201cdefinitely vote\u201d in the midterms.   Read more about how young voters may shape this election here.   Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate\u00a0Stacey Abrams will not participate in a debate with Republican Brian Kemp on Monday.   The debate was initially scheduled for Sunday evening in Atlanta, but Kemp backed out in order to attend a rally with President Donald Trump, who will be rallying for him in Macon.   Kemp\u2019s campaign later said it agreed to debate Abrams on Nov. 5, less than 12 hours before the polls open on Election Day.   \u201cUnfortunately, despite his own advice about the importance of honoring promises, Mr. Kemp has decided he will not be participating in the long-scheduled debate at the agreed upon time. With the news that Mr. Kemp will break his promise, we have moved forward and made plans to hold\u00a0our own\u00a0event on Sunday in which Stacey will talk with and answer questions from Georgians.\u00a0That\u2019s what we\u2019ve promised, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll deliver,\u201d Abrams\u2019 campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said in a statement.   The Abrams campaign said she will be holding an event on Sunday and plans to answer questions from Georgia residents.   Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum doesn\u2019t need to worry about President Trump not using his name anymore. Trump said it multiple times Wednesday night while campaigning alongside Republican Ron De Santis at a rally in Fort Myers.   Trump called Gillum a radical socialist, and said the Democrat wants to \u201cturn Florida into Venezuela.\u201d   \u201cAndrew Gillum wants to take a wrecking ball to one of the most successful economies anywhere in the world,\u201d the President said.   Trump criticized Gillum on multiple policies, adding that the Tallahassee mayor \u201cis too extreme for the people of Florida \u2014 they\u2019re not gonna take it long.\u201d   The crowd at one point started shouting \u201clock him up\u201d while DeSantis claimed Gillum bribed an FBI agent.   Some background: DeSantis has keyed in on Gillum\u2019s 2016 decision to accept a ticket to see the Broadway show \u201cHamilton\u201d from a group that included an undercover FBI agent,\u00a0according to text and email records\u00a0released under subpoena last week, as evidence that an ongoing federal corruption probe in Tallahassee is closer to the mayor than has been reported. DeSantis has also questioned whether a trip Gillum took that year to Costa Rica with his wife, along with lobbyist and longtime friend Adam Corey and his associates, was appropriate. Gillum has said he paid his own way.   No one connected to Gillum or the investigation has been charged with a crime, and Gillum has repeatedly said the FBI has told him he is not a focus of the probe. There has been no suggestion of outright thievery, as suggested by Trump, even by Gillum\u2019s political opponents. The probe centers on whether developers successfully influenced city projects, although at one point an undercover agent infiltrated Gillum\u2019s inner circle and attended the trip to New York with Corey, Gillum and Gillum\u2019s brother.   The second and final debate in the hotly contested Georgia governor\u2019s race is on ice.   For now, at least, Republican Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams will not meet again as planned on Sunday night, less than 48 hours out from Election Day.   The reason: President Donald Trump.   Trump is going to Georgia to stump for Kemp, the GOP secretary of state, on Sunday \u2014 and planned the event (4 p.m. ET in Macon) for just about the same time as the debate had been scheduled (5 p.m. ET in Atlanta).   For the Kemp campaign, there really wasn\u2019t much of a choice: they\u2019re rallying with Trump, about 90 miles away, and asking host station WSB, the Abrams campaign and libertarian candidate Ted Metz to shift accommodate them.   When Abrams and Metz said no, Kemp spokesman Ryan Mahoney tried to blame the Democrat.   \u201cWe offered multiple days, times, and venues to debate. Unfortunately, Stacey Abrams cancelled the WSB-TV debate. Abrams is ducking Georgia voters because she can\u2019t defend her extreme, radical agenda on live television,\u201d he tweeted on Wednesday.   In a statement, the Abrams campaign said Kemp\u2019s decision to appear with Trump \u2014 rather than at the debate \u2014 was \u201crobbing (Georgia voters) of their last chance to hear from both gubernatorial candidates ahead of Election Day.\u201d   \u201cIt is both unacceptable and unsurprising that Brian Kemp is yet again blaming his failures on someone else and not keeping his promises,\u201d Abrams\u2019 campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said. \u201cThis has been a pattern of behavior for him for as long as voters have known him.\u201d   WSB, though, is still holding out hope: anchor Craig Lucie tweeted on Wednesday afternoon that \u201cour debate with the GA Governor candidates is now up in the air.\u201d   The station is still searching for an agreeable alternative.   Oprah isn\u2019t the only celebrity campaigning and encouraging Americans to vote.   In an ad released Tuesday by Independence USA PAC, Cher, Julianne Moore, Constance Wu, and other celebrities ask viewers what issues they care about \u2013 like health care, gun violence and immigration \u2013 and encourage them to vote.   The Last Weekend, a campaign promoting get-out-the-vote volunteering backed by progressive groups, has also released a number of ads starring celebrities like Kerry Washington, Kevin Bacon, Jane Fonda and Rashida Jones.   \u201cHopefully, we created something that people will share with each other,\u201d Jones told Glamour. \u201cPeople are fatigued. And I\u2019m certainly fatigued of celebrity PSAs, so the joke was sort of (that) we ourselves are fatigued with our own PSA-ness.\u201d   Other celebrities have gotten involved in local races without filming ads. Taylor Swift has posted about her support for Tennessee\u2019s Democratic Senate candidate, Phil Bredesen, on Instagram, including on Tuesday, when she indicated that both she and her mother had voted for Bredesen.  A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)  President Trump talked about the GOP\u2019s midterm chances as he left the White House Wednesday for the first of 11 rallies before Election Day.   \u201cWe\u2019re doing very, very well in the Senate. A lot of seats that were not really being thought of in terms of victories a year ago now look like they very well could be victories. And the House is a lot of people. They\u2019re a lot of people. I think we\u2019re going to do well in the House also. But I know we\u2019re doing well in the Senate and it looks like we\u2019re doing okay in the House. We\u2019re going to have to see.\u00a0They\u2019re just so many people,\u201d Trump told reporters.   Pressed on the matter, he attempted to soften his initial take, saying, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to do well in the House. We\u2019re doing, really, extraordinarily well in the Senate.   The President said he won\u2019t blame House Speaker Paul Ryan or \u201canybody\u201d if Republicans lose the House.   Trump also said he doesn\u2019t believe his immigration rhetoric will have an impact on suburban districts come Election Day.   \u201cNo. I don\u2019t view suburban districts or any other districts. I view the country. Our country has to be safe,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd by the way, women \u2014 we\u2019re doing very well with the women vote because they want security. They want safety. They don\u2019t want these people pouring into our country totally unchecked.\u201d   President Trump will begin his final midterm election swing on Wednesday night in Florida, the epicenter of two acrimonious and tight races \u2013 for a Democratic-held Senate seat and the Republican-run governor\u2019s mansion.   He is expected to endorse former GOP congressman Ron DeSantis for the gubernatorial race, who is running against Democrat Andrew Gillum, mayor of Tallahassee.   Over the weekend, Trump unleashed a Twitter attack on Gillum, branding him a \u201cthief\u201d in what many observers saw as a racially tinged attack.   The Senate contest is expected to be a closer matchup between incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott. It has so far been the most expensive Senate race in the country, with Scott pouring huge sums of his own money into his campaign.   CNN\u2019s most recent polling\u00a0shows\u00a0Nelson with a five point lead Scott, and Gillum with a wide 12-point lead over DeSantis.   Out of the state\u2019s 27 seats in the House, there are two toss-up races, and three CNN rates as likely Republican.   A federal judge knocked down a motion from Georgia\u2019s Republican gubernatorial nominee Brian Kemp against a previous temporary restraining order that changes the way election officials handle absentee ballots in the state.   US District Court Judge Leigh Martin May rejected Kemp\u2019s arguments point by point and concluded the \u201cinjunction ensures that absentee voters who are unable to vote in person and whose applications or ballots are rejected based on a signature mismatch will still have the opportunity to have their votes counted in the upcoming election.\u201d   Kemp, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, also filed an emergency motion Tuesday with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. He argued, \u201cthe district court issued a preliminary injunction that requires 159 Georgia counties to make immediate, significant changes to those longstanding procedures right in the middle of an ongoing statewide general election,\u201d which he said threatens to \u201cdisrupt the orderly administration of elections.\u201d   Last week, May, the judge,\u00a0ordered\u00a0that Georgia election officials stop rejecting absentee ballots with voters\u2019 signatures that do not appear to match those on record.   Why this matters: Kemp is the Republican running for governor against Democratic former state Rep. Stacey Abrams. In a recent debate, Abrams accused Kemp, who has been the secretary of state for eight years, of creating \u201can atmosphere of fear around the right to vote in the state of Georgia.\u201d   In total, election officials in Georgia have rejected 157 absentee ballots for signature mismatch issues, according to state data analyzed by CNN last Wednesday. More than 881,000 absentee ballots have been cast.   Gwinnett County has also faced criticism from voting rights activists who say the rejections disproportionately affect minority voters. The county has rejected more than 600 absentee ballots as of last Wednesday, though only a small fraction of those were tossed for signature mismatches. Others were rejected for missing birthdates, address discrepancies and other reasons.   Media icon Oprah Winfrey will hit the campaign trail this week for Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.   Winfrey will participate in two town hall events with Abrams \u2013 one in Marietta and one in Decatur \u2013 on Thursday to aide her campaign in what has become a highly competitive, closely watched race.   \u201cOprah Winfrey has inspired so many of us through the years with her unparalleled ability to form real connections and strengthen the bonds of family and community,\u201d Abrams said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cI am honored to have Oprah join me for uplifting and honest conversations with voters about the clear choice before us in this election and the boundless potential of Georgians.\u201d   As President Trump kicks off an 11-rally tour in the final six days of the midterm election campaign, he is focused on expanding Republican control of the Senate \u2014 without jeopardizing it.   He will pay two visits to Florida, Missouri and Indiana, all home of key Senate races, in addition to stops in Montana, West Virginia and Tennessee. (He also visits Ohio and Georgia.)   But two states noticeably absent from his itinerary: Arizona and Nevada, which are among the most competitive races and the best chance for Democrats to pick up GOP-held Senate seats (as our new CNN polls today illustrate).   Here\u2019s why: Two Republican officials involved in shaping the President\u2019s political travel tell CNN that Republicans in both Arizona and Nevada asked the White House to steer clear of those states in his final swing. Both states were on an early list of places Trump hoped to hit, officials say, but were taken off the final schedule because a presidential visit wasn\u2019t seen as helpful to Rep. Martha McSally in Arizona and Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada.   \u201cHe\u2019s been very helpful rallying his base, but he\u2019s not helpful there now,\u201d one Republican official directly involved in the races said. \u201cWe asked him to go elsewhere.\u201d   The President visited Arizona and Nevada earlier this month. But in the final stretch, he is largely focusing on Trump-friendly red states, rather than battlegrounds like Nevada and Arizona.   Trump\u2019s closing message on immigration \u2014 particularly his call to end birthright citizenship \u2014 is seen by Republicans in both states as detrimental to their message, officials said, with the prospect of rallying Independents and Democrats.   Watch more:   Election Day is less than one week away, and voters will cast their ballots in a slew of races.   Here\u2019s which seats are up:   Here\u2019s what that breakdown looks like:   With exactly one week until Election Day, at least 20 million people across the country have already cast their ballots for the midterms as of Wednesday morning.   CNN is partnering with Catalist, a data company that works with Democrats and others, to compile counts of ballots cast before Election Day, either early in-person or by mail.   Votes coming in from seven critical states show that more women than men have voted.   The early vote is also predominantly older in the seven states \u2014 although a higher percentage of early voters are often older.   Why are federal elections always in November, and always on Tuesdays? It all comes down to weather, harvests and worship.   Back when voters traveled to the polls by horse, Tuesday was an ideal day because it allows people to worship on Sunday, ride to their county seat on Monday and vote on Tuesday \u2014 all before market day, Wednesday.   And the month of November fit nicely between harvest time and brutal winter weather (which can be especially bad when you\u2019re trudging along by horse and buggy).   The tradition stuck, even though many voters now travel by horsepower instead of live horses.   This election is essentially a referendum on President Trump.   Depending on what voters decide to do with Congress, Trump may approach the last two years of his current term with the wind at his back or headwinds to his face.   So what happens if \u2026   As of today,\u00a0at least\u00a020,067,826\u00a0votes have been cast early or by mail nationwide, according to data collected by Catalist.   CNN is partnering with Catalist, a data company that works with Democrats and others, to compile counts of ballots cast before Election Day, either early in-person or by-mail.   So what does that mean? Read up on what early voting numbers do \u2014 and don\u2019t \u2014 tell us here.   President Trump is holding 11 rallies across eight states in the final days\u00a0before the midterm election, the White House said.   The President wanted to commit to an \u201cunprecedented amount of political travel\u201d and \u201ceclipse his predecessors,\u201d according to person familiar with his thinking.   Here\u2019s where Trump is rallying:   The Republican Party is all in on President Trump. Now, with one week before the midterm elections, he\u2019s going all out for them.   Undeterred by the string of deadly horrors that might have paused another president in campaign mode, Trump is stumping relentlessly in a late push to save the GOP House and Senate majorities, using rallies and Twitter to stoke fear over a group of migrants nearly 1,000 miles from the US border while boosting false claims from Republican candidates about their efforts to tear up one of Obamacare\u2019s most popular features.   Then, on Wednesday, he kicks off a swing of 11 rallies in six days.   Operatives in both parties and nonpartisan analysts have coalesced around a view that Republicans appear likely to benefit from a favorable map and keep control of the Senate, perhaps even padding their majority. But the GOP\u2019s grip on the House is slipping. After two years of unified Republican rule, the Democratic Party\u2019s base is rallying around a crop of first time candidates and now has a variety of potential paths to winning the 23 seats they need to regain a measure of control on Capitol Hill.   Trump has said that he shouldn\u2019t be blamed for a Republican midterm wipeout, but his travel schedule this week \u2013 and the $22 million in transfers his re-election campaign has made to the Republican National Committee this cycle \u2013 suggests he knows better. That even beyond pride, he has a lot to lose on Election Day.   A \u201cblue wave\u201d on November 6 would immediately sink Trump\u2019s more ambitious political plans while exposing his administration to the kind of oversight Republican lawmakers have largely forsaken.   \u201cI\u2019m not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket because this is also a referendum about me,\u201d Trump said at a rally earlier this month in Mississippi. \u201cI want you to vote. Pretend I\u2019m on the ballot.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

But the company has itself taken part in anti-Semitic commentary, deleted tweets show.   When a Twitter user called for Gab to be shut down on August 9, the @getongab account responded with this: \u201cDude named \u2018Krassenstein\u2019 doesn\u2019t support free speech. Imagine my shock.\u201d Half an hour later, Gab\u2019s account shared a Christian Bible verse that refers to Jews who do not believe in Jesus Christ as members of the \u201csynagogue of Satan.\u201d   In September, the Gab Twitter account posted photos of two men: Ken White, a popular lawyer and libertarian blogger, and Benny Polatseck, the founder of a public relations firm that does extensive work for Jewish interests. In the shared photo, Polatseck was in traditional Orthodox Jewish garb, his hair in sidelocks. Gab tweeted: \u201cThese two guys show up at your front door. Who do you let in and who do you call the cops on?\u201d The account followed with: \u201cI mean I\u2019m calling the cops on both and getting my shotgun ready, just saying.\u201d   Some who have been monitoring activity on Gab have warned that its lack of rules on hate speech has allowed neo-Nazis and other violent white nationalist groups to share content. Michael Edison Hayden, an open source intelligence analyst at Storyful, noted over the weekend that \u201cthe neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division and others plotting violence are organizing on that platform out in the open.\u201d   Archived posts on Gab captured by the left-leaning group Media Matters show that white nationalist Christopher Cantwell \u2013 who gained notoriety after being profiled in a Vice documentary about racists at the 2017 Unite the Right rally \u2013 had an anti-Jewish welcome message to new Gab users that went viral on the site.   Since Gab\u2019s inception in 2016, its founders have been open about their intention to create what amounts to a safe space for right-wing people who feel unwelcome on more mainstream social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter. Those long-established online services are increasingly cracking down on users who attack others with racist remarks, spread xenophobic conspiracy theories about other races and cultures, and distribute hateful disinformation. Gab has repeatedly stated its mission to welcome users who engage in this kind of behavior.   \u201cGab welcomes everyone, but sees a unique opportunity to carve a niche in a massively underserved and unrepresented market. We estimate that there are over 50 million conservative, libertarian, nationalist, and populist internet users from around the world who are seeking an alternative to the current social networking ecosystems. These users are also actively seeking out alternative media platforms like Breitbart.com, DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com, and others,\u201d Gab stated in a company filing dated July 11, 2017.   The social media platform has come under public scrutiny this week as it was discovered that Robert Bowers, the man charged with killing 11 people at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life synagogue, had used his Gab page to make racist posts about Jews. Bowers\u2019 final post on Gab announced his imminent attack on the synagogue.   In the wake of the shooting, Gab denounced the act of violence and issued this statement online: \u201cGab has spent the past 48 hours proudly working with the DOJ and FBI to bring justice to an alleged terrorist. Because of the data we provided, they now have plenty of evidence for their case. Please pray for all involved and the victims.\u201d   Gab\u2019s terms of service prohibited \u201ccalling for the acts of violence against others, promoting or engaging in self-harm, and/or acts of cruelty, [and] threatening language or behaviour that clearly, directly and incontrovertibly infringes on the safety of another user or individual(s).\u201d   But the event caused the internet infrastructure companies supporting Gab to act. This week, Gab announced that it had been \u201csystematically no-platformed.\u201d The website stopped working because, Gab said, it had been \u201cbanned\u201d over the past 24 hours by payment processing firms PayPal and Stripe, as well as hosting service Joyent and domain register GoDaddy.   Two of Gab\u2019s three top executives have quit in recent months because of the public backlash against the website. Co-founder and chief technology officer Ekrem B\u00fcy\u00fckkaya, who describes himself as an anti-Trump Muslim living in Turkey, reportedly announced his departure via Gab on Sunday. \u201cThe attacks from the American press have been relentless for two years now and have taken a toll on me personally,\u201d he wrote.   The company\u2019s chief operating officer, Utsav Sanduja, told CNN on Monday he left Gab in June for the same reason. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough to govern a site with quite a lot of negative publicity, hacking, targeted harassment campaigns,\u201d he said. But Sanduja remained adamant in his support of Gab\u2019s mission to provide a social media platform for unrestricted speech, even if it included hateful, racist conspiracies and disinformation. Sanduja defended the synagogue shooter\u2019s right to post anti-Semitic posts about the mass killing of Jews, calling it \u201cartistic expression,\u201d and said Bowers committed no harm until he announced his \u201cimminent, lawless\u201d attack on the religious center. Sanduja told CNN that the social media site drew the line on revenge porn, public posting of another person\u2019s private information, and explicit threats to politicians. Sanduja also said the company has repeatedly helped law enforcement gain information on users and sometimes proactively reported them to police.   The recent departure of two executive officers is a blow for a company that has, in its own corporate filings, acknowledged that it\u2019s on shaky ground. \u201cOur ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows,\u201d the company noted in its 2018 annual report. \u201cNo assurance can be given that we will be successful,\u201d the report adds. Gab.com, a private corporation, was attempting to raise cash through crowdfunding \u2013 specifically by selling investors \u201cGAB Tokens\u201d \u2013 which necessitated filings with the SEC.   In that same document, Gab.com acknowledged its future depended on key personnel, including the now departed B\u00fcy\u00fckkaya. It appears the company didn\u2019t even have its own office space. The Philadelphia address listed on official SEC filings was occupied by Gab.com for only a month, when the company rented space from a desk-share company in the building, according to a spokesperson to the realty company that owns the building.

The flyers could become an issue for Sinema, the Democratic nominee challenging Republican Martha McSally in one of the most competitive US Senate races this year. CNN rates the race as a toss-up.   Currently one of only 18 members of the Blue Dog Coalition in Congress, a caucus of centrist and conservative Democrats that once boasted 54 members, Sinema\u2019s time organizing anti-war rallies highlights how her views have shifted since the early 2000s, when she ran for state and local office as an independent affiliated with the Green Party and was viewed as one of the most progressive activists in Arizona.   \u201cKyrsten comes from a military family and is very proud of her record supporting Arizona\u2019s servicemembers, veterans, and their families,\u201d Sinema campaign spokeswoman Helen Hare said in an emailed comment to CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cAttacks on Kyrsten\u2019s respect for those who serve have already been called out as false, and Kyrsten is going to stay focused on the issues that matter most to Arizonans \u2013 like making sure Congresswoman McSally and her allies can\u2019t roll back protections for patients with pre-existing conditions.\u201d   Related article CNN Key Race Alert: This is the narrow path to a Democratic Senate   Hare added that Sinema did not approve or design the flyers at the time. The campaign further noted that two of her brothers have served in the military and that one remains on active duty in the Navy.   McSally has previously attacked Sinema\u2019s anti-war past and accused Sinema of \u201cdenigrating\u201d the service of the US armed forces in her protests of the Iraq War. Sinema\u2019s campaign has denied those charges and said that while Sinema opposed US intervention in Iraq, she always supported servicemembers.   The flyers, which are available through the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, promoted a February 2003 rally organized by Local to Global Justice, an anti-war group Sinema co-founded. Sinema was referred to as a leading organizer and sponsor of the anti-Iraq War rally in contemporaneous news reports and websites for the organizations involved. She is also repeatedly listed as the point of contact for the event.   One flyer for the February 2003 event read: \u201cYou can help us push back U.S. terror in Iraq and the Middle East.\u201d Above the text there was a cartoon depicting a group of protestors striving to halt the progress of three skeletons, one dressed as a soldier, another dressed in a top hat holding a dollar bill and another dressed in a suit. The flyer listed the website for Sinema\u2019s group and an email of a local anarchist group that also participated.   Another flyer urged direct action \u201cagainst Bush and his fascist, imperialist war.\u201d A cartoon on the flyer said, \u201cGovernment is slavery,\u201d and \u201cIts laws are cobwebs for the rich and chains of steel for the poor.\u201d The flier contained the email for a local anarchist group that was a rally co-sponsor.   A third flyer said, \u201cSpeak out against the war\u201d and \u201cStop the OILigarchy.\u201d It depicted a large group of trumpets standing in the path of an oncoming American tank with a bodiless pair of eyes in a helmet poking out of the top. The flyer listed Sinema\u2019s personal email at the time.   Sinema also spoke at the rally, according to Arizona State University\u2019s student newspaper, which quoted her as the organizer of the rally in which they estimated 2,500 people attended.   \u201cLet peace rule,\u201d Sinema said, according to the paper.   Sinema was also listed at the point of contact for a pre-rally event to make protest signs. The website for the event highlights signs from past events, including, \u201cBorn to Kill, Born to Drill,\u201d \u201cMy President Is A Psychopath,\u201d \u201cNo Oilgarchy,\u201d \u201cWe Burn Stuff (Written on an American Flag)\u201d and \u201cWho Elected this F***er?\u201d   Reflecting on the rally a year later, in an interview with local media KTAR, Sinema said the war was about American access to oil.   \u201cSo this is not about the United States doing the right and moral thing by a toppling an evil dictator,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is more about the United States having access to the oil and the power and control and world stature that it\u2019s seeking. It\u2019s not about the individuals in Iraq.\u201d   Sinema\u2019s past political positions are a contrast from the more moderate profile she has developed since her 2012 election to Congress.   As a congresswoman, she has voted against approving the Iran deal and, this past April, backed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to strike Syria. In 2015, she voted with Republicans to stop admitting Syrian and Iraqi refugees until the vetting process was strengthened.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Samuel Patten, who was charged Friday with acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Ukrainians, has an extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that includes ties to other individuals caught up in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and work with the controversial political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.   Related article Lobbyist pleads guilty, says he helped steer foreign money to Trump inaugural and lied to Congress   Patten, 47, reached a plea deal with the Justice Department. He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the felony charge and has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.   Patten\u2019s personal website describes him as a \u201cstrategic advisor\u201d who has worked in politics on four continents. He has taken on numerous roles for campaigns and organizations over the last two decades, including as Eurasia director for the pro-democracy organization Freedom House in Washington, as well as a consultant for politicians in Ukraine, Georgia, Iraq and Nigeria, among other countries.   In the early to mid-2000s, Patten worked in Moscow for another pro-democracy organization, the International Republican Institute, along with Konstantin Kilimnik, who has been charged by Mueller\u2019s office with obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice.   Business records list Patten as an executive of the company Begemot Ventures International with Kilimnik in 2015, which is touted as \u201ca strategic and political advisory firm that helps its clients win elections, strengthen political parties \u2026 and achieve better results\u201d on its website, which does not list any clients.   Prosecutors have said in separate court filings that Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik is also a close business associate of President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who also did political work in Ukraine and has been found guilty on eight counts of financial crimes.   Patten performed various services for Cambridge Analytica, the company that became embroiled in controversy earlier this year due to its sweeping collection of Facebook data, as well as its parent company SCL Group.   Brittany Kaiser, a former director at Cambridge Analytica, described Patten in testimony before the British Parliament as a \u201ctrusted senior consultant\u201d to SCL Group. She said Patten did work for SCL in Nigeria and that he helped to organize an event on Capitol Hill in Washington.   Related article Nearly two-thirds oppose firing Sessions, back Mueller   Patten confirmed his involvement with Cambridge Analytica to The Daily Beast, saying he assisted the firm\u2019s US projects in 2014 and also \u201cseveral overseas campaigns.\u201d He declined to provide further detail, citing a nondisclosure agreement.   On Facebook, Patten posted a photograph of himself in 2014 with Oregon congressional candidate Art Robinson, whose campaign paid Cambridge Analytica about $20,000 that year.   Separately, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica for its data services in 2016.   Friday\u2019s charging documents state that Patten worked with an unnamed Russian to place op-ed articles in US media in 2017 and was paid more than $1 million for the Ukrainian opposition bloc work, including meeting with members of the executive branch, Senate Foreign Relations Committee members and other members of Congress.   The Ukrainian opposition bloc is a largely pro-Russian party. The group emerged in 2014 in opposition to the wave of Ukrainian protests and demonstrations that ousted former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.   In 2014, Patten wrote an op-ed for The Hill in the lead-up to the Ukrainian elections in which he called for \u201cpolitical balance\u201d that did not ostracize the opposition bloc.   \u201cGroups such as the Opposition Bloc, which consists of figures from eastern Ukraine, must perform well in the elections,\u201d he wrote.   An archived page on Patten\u2019s personal website also notes that he helped steer the re-election campaign of Vitali Klitschko, a Ukrainian politician who was elected mayor of Kiev in 2014.   Court documents show that Patten has also crossed paths with Rinat Akhmetshin, the Russian-American lobbyist who has promoted Kremlin-aligned interests in Washington and who was present at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with senior Trump campaign officials.   In a deposition for a civil lawsuit, Akhmetshin said he was retained to provide opposition research on a former Russian politician, Ashot Egiazaryan, and that he \u201capproached\u201d Patten about the matter.   Akhmetshin said Patten did him a favor in 2011 by letting him \u201cknow that Mr. Egiazaryan is coming to Washington. That\u2019s the nature of courtesy.\u201d   Patten has no prior criminal history, his plea agreement said. His defense attorney declined to comment following the hearing.   In a 2017 interview with an academic researching SCL Group, Patten reflected on his experience in international political consulting and said, \u201cI\u2019ve worked in Ukraine, Iraq. I\u2019ve worked in deeply corrupt countries, and our (US) system isn\u2019t very different.\u201d   Despite his lobbying work for the pro-Russian opposition bloc, Patten\u2019s website states that he previously worked with Russian opposition leader and Putin critic Boris Nemtsov, who was murdered in 2015 two days before a planned demonstration.   Patten has also openly critiqued Russia\u2019s human rights record.   In 2010, as a senior program officer at Freedom House, Patten testified before Congress and denounced Russian government officials and called for the US to increase its support of Russians pushing for government reform.   \u201cWhen confronted with evidence of their criminality, their misrule and their abuse of human rights, Russian Government officials generally do one of three things: They will obfuscate, they will offer stale comparisons, or they will ratchet up the level of vitriol in their rhetoric,\u201d Patten told members of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission at the time.

CNN\u2019s KFile reached out to the White House last week about Darren Beattie, a policy aide and speechwriter, who was listed as speaking at the 2016 H.L. Mencken Club Conference.   The Mencken Club, which is named for the early 20th century journalist and satirist whose posthumously published diaries revealed racist views, is a small annual conference started in 2008 and regularly attended by well-known white nationalists such as Richard Spencer. The schedule for the 2016 conference listed panels and speeches by white nationalist Peter Brimelow and two writers, John Derbyshire and Robert Weissberg, who were both fired in 2012 from the conservative magazine National Review for espousing racist views.   Other speakers from the 2016 conference are regular contributors to the white nationalist website VDare. Jared Taylor, another leading white nationalist, can be heard at the conference in 2016 on Derbyshire\u2019s radio show along with Brimelow.   The White House, which asked CNN to hold off on the story for several days last week declined to say when Beattie left the White House. Beattie\u2019s email address at the White House, which worked until late Friday evening, was no longer active by Saturday.   \u201cMr. Beattie no longer works at the White House,\u201d White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told CNN on Friday night. \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on personnel matters.\u201d   Beattie confirmed to CNN he spoke to the 2016 conference, saying his speech was not objectionable. Two days after publication of this story, Beattie provided CNN with what he said was the full text of his speech at the conference.   \u201cIn 2016 I attended the Mencken conference in question and delivered a stand-alone, academic talk titled \u2018The Intelligentsia and the Right.\u2019 I said nothing objectionable and stand by my remarks completely,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s KFile in an email on Saturday. \u201cIt was the honor of my life to serve in the Trump Administration. I love President Trump, who is a fearless American hero, and continue to support him one hundred percent. I have no further comment.\u201d   Beattie gained prominence in 2016 when as a visiting instructor in Duke University\u2019s political science department he signed on to a letter of academic scholars supporting Trump. He correctly predicted Trump would win the 2016 presidential election.   As a professor, Beattie wrote an editorial for Duke\u2019s student newspaper in support of the travel ban and has said he supported Trump\u2019s candidacy from the beginning, citing his position on immigration.

Pence made the argument in two columns in the late 1990s, where he wrote that then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s admission of an affair with a White House intern and prior lies to the public about the matter, possibly under oath, meant Clinton should be removed from office.   Related article Trump Supreme Court pick: Presidents can ignore laws they think are unconstitutional   Yet Pence also moved beyond the specifics of the Clinton case: He made a far-reaching argument about the importance of morality and integrity to the office of the presidency.   Pence wrote the columns in the late 1990s when he was a local Indiana radio host and prominent conservative voice in the state arguing Clinton had lost his moral authority to lead the country. One of the columns, \u201cThe Two Schools of Thought on Clinton,\u201d was posted on his now-defunct website for his radio talk show. Another column, \u201cWhy Clinton Must Resign or Be Impeached,\u201d was posted on his congressional campaign website. Both columns were archived by the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. The columns ran in various Indiana newspapers at the time but did not get national attention.   Dismissing the idea that the president is \u201cjust the like the rest of us,\u201d Pence wrote, \u201cIf you and I fall into bad moral habits, we can harm our families, our employers and our friends. The President of the United States can incinerate the planet. Seriously, the very idea that we ought to have at or less than the same moral demands placed on the Chief Executive that we place on our next door neighbor is ludicrous and dangerous.   \u201cThroughout our history, we have seen the presidency as the repository of all of our highest hopes and ideals and values. To demand less is to do an injustice to the blood that bought our freedoms.\u201d   Related article Donald Trump is twisting himself in knots trying to explain the Trump Tower meeting   The revelation of Pence\u2019s Clinton-era columns comes as President Donald Trump faces allegations of extramarital affairs from former adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. The President also faces a defamation suit brought by former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant Summer Zervos, who says Trump sexually assaulted her a decade ago. Trump has denied all the allegations.   Trump also denied knowledge of payments made to Daniels and McDougal during the 2016 presidential campaign but subsequent statements and recordings have raised questions about his denials.   Pence has largely remained silent on the allegations and called Daniels\u2019 assertions of an affair \u201cbaseless.\u201d   In addition to the moral argument Pence makes in the columns, he focused on the fact that Clinton was in office when his affair took place and that he \u201cvery likely\u201d committed perjury when he denied in a deposition having a \u201csexual relationship\u201d with Monica Lewinsky. The allegations against Trump all took place before he stepped into public office, and Trump has not testified about the alleged affairs and therefore does not face any allegations he lied under oath about them. But Pence was not exclusively concerned about Clinton\u2019s misstatements under oath, also arguing that Clinton\u2019s public statements about Lewinsky damaged the institution of the presidency.   The Vice President\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment on the columns.   Trump is also facing questions about his statements concerning any relationship between his campaign and Russia. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between his son Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer was \u201ca meeting to get information on an opponent.\u201d It was the most direct admission yet of the true intent of the meeting and also an acknowledgement that Trump Jr.\u2019s initial explanation for the meeting \u2013 that its primary purpose was to discuss adoptions - was grossly misleading. That explanation came in a statement that was dictated by the President.   Related article President urged to stop tweeting on Trump Tower meeting   In one of his columns about Clinton, Pence wrote, \u201cFurther, the Presidents (sic) repeated lies to the American people in this matter compound the case against him as they demonstrate his failure to protect the institution of the presidency as the \u2018inspiring supreme symbol of all that is highest in our American ideals.\u2019\u201d   He continued, \u201cLeaders affect the lives of families far beyond their own \u2018private life\u2019. In the Bible story of Esther we are told of a king who was charged to put right his own household because there would be \u2018no end of disrespect and discord\u2019 among the families of the kingdom if he failed to do so. In a day when reckless extramarital sexual activity is manifesting itself in our staggering rates of illegitimacy and divorce, now more than ever, America needs to be able to look to her First Family as role models of all that we have been and can be again.\u201d   Pence also wrote that Republicans needed to act to remove Clinton even if it meant losing the majority in Congress.   \u201cIf our leaders flinch at this responsibility, they would do well to heed the Proverb \u2018if a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cOur leaders must either act to restore the luster and dignity of the institution of the Presidency or we can be certain that this is only the beginning of an even more difficult time for our land.

CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed hours of audio from Darla Shine\u2019s radio program after her controversial views came to light. Shine, who long maintained a blog called \u201cHappy Housewives Club\u201d where she featured recipes and tips for cleaning and budgeting and promoted her radio show and book, has faced scrutiny in recent days after Mediaite and Huffington Post reported she had made racially charged comments and spread baseless anti-vaccination conspiracy theories on her now-deleted Twitter account.   Shine pushed her controversial views to a much wider audience and in much more depth on the \u201cDarla Shine Show,\u201d a radio broadcast she hosted on the Talk Radio Network in 2008 and 2009 that boasted syndication on 100 radio stations nationwide.   Speaking in August 2009, Shine declared herself a \u201csexist\u201d and said women serving with men in the military should expect to be sexually harassed.   \u201cAnd why on earth would you fight to go on the submarine ship for months on end? You know there was just a story with these girls, these women who are upset that they are sexually harassed in the military,\u201d Shine said. \u201cWhat do you think is going to happen when you go on a submarine for 12 months with 4,000 horny soldiers?   \u201cI hate to say it, but it\u2019s true. They should not even be allowed. The top military should say, \u2018No way, you\u2019re not allowed.\u2019 But you know, the feminists have fought for these rights. It\u2019s so stupid. I don\u2019t know why anybody would want that.\u201d   Bill Shine exited his job as president of Fox News in 2017 amid allegations he had mishandled reports of sexual harassment at the network. He joined the White House earlier this month.   Darla Shine routinely had on as guests prominent members of the anti-vaccination movement and pushed conspiracy theories about vaccines herself. Shine also weighed in on cultural and political issues.   Related article White House announces hiring of former Fox News exec Bill Shine   She did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The White House did not respond to CNN KFile\u2019s request about whether Bill Shine endorses his wife\u2019s views.   Darla Shine devoted much of the time on her radio show to spreading unfounded and debunked conspiracy theories about vaccinations.   In various episodes, Shine suggested a flu pandemic could be a \u201csetup\u201d by the government in collusion with pharmaceutical companies, pushed a rumor that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was planning on rounding up those afflicted with swine flu and putting them in camps, and said the government could break into homes and force citizens to get the flu vaccine.   Shine said armed resistance might be needed to fight against this. She also called for the closing all US borders because of the swine flu.   Shine declared sunscreen \u201ca hoax\u201d and said she refused to put it on her children.   The American Academy of Dermatology has said there is no evidence that sunscreen is hazardous, while the Food and Drug Administration has declared that there is no link between vaccines and autism.   Shine also passed on a false \u201crumor\u201d that Barack Obama could not get a security clearance when running for president.   She claimed to believe in UFOs and interviewed self-identified alien abductees.   At the top of her radio program, a man\u2019s voice reads out a disclaimer, saying, \u201cWarning: This is the \u2018Darla Shine Show.\u2019 Everything you hear is Darla\u2019s opinion. Some facts are true; others are made up. So take what you want, use what you can and you get what you get so don\u2019t get upset.\u201d   On women in the military:   \u201cAnd you know what, I\u2019m the first person to admit I\u2019m sexist. I don\u2019t think that girls should play on the boys\u2019 high school team. I don\u2019t think that the girls should be \u2013 I think it\u2019s insanity that there are feminists who are stupid enough to fight to go to combat. Are you kidding me? Let the men go die on the front lines,\u201d Shine said in an August 2009 episode. \u201cWhy would you want to go die on the front line? You have to be an idiot. And why on earth would you fight to go on the submarine ship for months on end? You know there was just a story with these girls, these women who are upset that they are sexually harassed in the military. What do you think is going to happen when you go on a submarine for 12 months with 4,000 horny soldiers? I hate to say it, but it\u2019s true. They should not even be allowed. The top military should say, \u2018No way, you\u2019re not allowed.\u2019 But you know, but you know the feminists have fought for these rights. It\u2019s so stupid. I don\u2019t know why anybody would want that.\u201d   Spread the conspiracy theory that Obama couldn\u2019t get a security clearance:   \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you heard the rumor that Barack Obama couldn\u2019t get a security clearance required to work for the FBI or CIA,\u201d Shine said in a November 2008 show. \u201cAnd I want to know if this is true. I mean I\u2019m just a little housewife at home, living my life, taking care of my children. But I\u2019m concerned if we\u2019re going to have a president that could not pass a security clearance. Especially, aren\u2019t we in a war against terrorism? Aren\u2019t we, like, fighting terrorists? So why wouldn\u2019t we have a security check for a man who\u2019s going to run the country? And I mean not just Barack Obama, but what about our senators, our congresspeople? Do they go through the same security background check as a CIA person would have to go through? I never thought about this.\u201d   On sunscreen:   \u201cI really do not believe in this whole sunscreen hoax. It just seems ridiculous to me to take your little infant \u2013 the number one organ in your body is your skin,\u201d Shine said in a May 2008 episode, \u201cBut yet we take these chemicals and slather it all over our little babies\u2019 bodies to be soaked in day after day, sweating into their body. I just can\u2019t think that this is good. So let\u2019s just use common sense. Guess what? Keep your baby out of the sun. It\u2019s pretty easy to do. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that difficult if you have a little newborn baby.\u201d   On closing the borders:   On a May 2009 episode, in response to the ongoing swine flu pandemic, Shine said, \u201cPeople can say that I\u2019m a racist and I\u2019m a terrorist or I\u2019m extreme because I want to shut the borders, but right now I\u2019m thinking if we are going to go to a level six, we do need to shut down our borders. We don\u2019t let anyone in and we shouldn\u2019t let anyone out. We should protect our country.\u201d   On rumors of FEMA camps:   \u201cRumors flying around that FEMA is ready to round you up and take you off to a concentration camp,\u201d Shine said in May 2009. \u201cForget about socialism. I think we\u2019re headed towards full blown communism and forget about your freedom of speech. Radio hosts are being kicked off the air for suggesting that we close our borders and stay away from illegal immigrants. Are you kidding me? What is going on? I am willing to get kicked off the air. Here I am. Come and get me. I am going down with a fight. Why on earth are we not allowed to have this conversation? There\u2019s a country that has a full blown epidemic and it\u2019s called Mexico. Why on earth is it racist for us to say we need to close our borders to them at this time?\u201d   On vaccines:   Claimed the 2009 flu pandemic could be a \u201csetup\u201d:   \u201cSo back when Bush was still in office, they bring over this, this pharmaceutical company,\u201d Shine said in a May 2009 interview with anti-vaccination activist Rita Palma. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pharmaceutical, it\u2019s a vaccination company, Novaris (sic), but they make drugs also. So they are here in the United States and their goal, their number one reason for existing here is to make a flu vaccination. And then all of a sudden we have this big pandemic. It almost sounds like it\u2019s a setup.\u201d   Claimed the government wants people to be \u201cdiabetic and cancer-ridden\u201d so they can\u2019t think for themselves:   \u201cThey don\u2019t want people to be healthy,\u201d Shine said in the same 2009 interview with Palma, speculating as to why the government does not remove toxic food products from the shelves. \u201cIf people were really healthy \u2013 everyone is fat and overweight \u2013 and the next half-hour we\u2019re going to talk about how we can cut back on our favorite summer foods and cut calories with Cooking Light executive chef \u2013 but if they keep everyone fat and overweight and diabetic and cancer-ridden and stupid and sick, no one has any willpower to fight back or even think for themselves. That\u2019s what the goal is.\u201d   Said vaccines make children sicker to get people to buy more medication:   \u201cWhy do they even want to do this? Do you think they care if you get sick or I get sick?\u201d Shine asked of the government in a May 2008 episode. \u201cI think they do care because they want you to get sick so you could buy more meds, more pharmaceuticals, more drugs. Why aren\u2019t they pushing instead, instead of putting out this idea to have another vaccination, why not put out a proposal to \u2013 guess what \u2013 live healthier? Oh, we have soda machines and ice cream machines in the schools. We have irradiated meat and toxic cows that we\u2019re using to the \u2013 give to the kids for lunch. OK, but let\u2019s give them the flu vaccine too. Let\u2019s get them sick. Let\u2019s make them obese, but let\u2019s give them the flu vaccine. Now we\u2019ve got to vaccinate our kids for the chicken pox. What\u2019s wrong with having the chicken pox? It\u2019s ridiculous. Why not instead teach Americans how to boost their children\u2019s immunity? Well, I\u2019ll tell you this. If your child continues to get these vaccinations over and over, I think it compromises their immunity. This is my opinion. I\u2019m not a doctor, but I do all the research. And, listen, some vaccinations I think we need, but do our children need to have all of these other ridiculous ones like meningitis and chicken pox and now the flu? It\u2019s insanity.\u201d   Claimed that small children\u2019s bodies can\u2019t handle vaccines:   \u201cWhen we were children we had what, three vaccinations and they were spread out and we got them older. Now they have these newborn babies that are getting this five-in-one vaccination. Their little bodies cannot handle this,\u201d Shine also said in May 2008 while interviewing anti-vaccination activist John Gilmore. \u201cAnd what I want to know from you, and I\u2019m going to keep you on after we go to the commercial, but what I know from you is what is the government up to \u2013 like, really, if I get the flu or my kids get the flu, they could care less. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be happy if I dropped dead so I can stop trashing them each week on the radio. So what on earth are they up to? Are we really gonna do this to our society just so people can make money?\u201d   On forced vaccinations and armed resistance:   In August 2009, Shine said the government was going to put people in camps to force untested vaccines on them.   \u201cThere are some people dying, but does this mean that we rush a vaccine to market without even testing this vaccination? First of all, this flu is mutating like crazy. It\u2019s changing every single day, so whatever they\u2019re putting together is not going to protect you from the swine flu in the fall. Number two, billions of dollars of government tax money, your money and my money, is paying these drug companies to rush this to the market. This way fat cats can make more money in their pocket. This is publicly traded, and they\u2019re going to test it on your children. You have to start reading this. I started reading about this. They\u2019re putting together underneath the Homeland Security Act. They can round you up. They could break into your house, hold you down, give you this freaking vaccination. They could give it to your kid at school. I can\u2019t even believe it. They\u2019re putting together quarantine camps. Is this happening in America?\u201d   \u201cI have a woman coming on who\u2019s an expert on this. When you hear what she has to say, you better just get your gun locked and loaded and start putting big locks on your doors,\u201d Shine added.   Called mandated vaccines unconstitutional:   \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be forced to vaccinate our children,\u201d Shine said in August 2009. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be forced to give our children what we don\u2019t want to give them. It\u2019s unconstitutional. We have the power over our families and if we allow that loss, if we lose that power, I ask you this, what is next, folks? I want you to think about that all week. What will be next if we allow this happen?\u201d   Said vaccines are linked to autism:   \u201cWhen we come back, I want to ask you about this, what I believe is an obvious link to autism and mercury, the preservatives and the shots,\u201d Shine said on a May 2008 show. \u201cBut guys, we have a constitutional right to take care of her own family. This is ridiculous. You know what, instead of mandating the flu shot, the government should be worrying about creating jobs in America.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli is running to replace retiring Republican Rep. Charlie Dent in what is now Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th District. Morganelli, who is a centrist Democrat running in a crowded field of six primary candidates, is backed by United Together, a group with reported ties with the bipartisan organization No Labels, and longtime Clinton associate Lanny Davis.   The race in Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th district pits the more conservative Morganelli against a slate of more liberal candidates, illustrating the intra-party ideological fights playing out nationwide among Democrats. Heading into Tuesday\u2019s primary, progressive groups are concerned that Morganelli, someone who once floated going to work for Trump\u2019s administration, could emerge as the party\u2019s nominee.   Morganelli has long been a hardliner on immigration, breaking with his party and advocating for a crackdown on illegal immigration. Since announcing his run in January, Morganelli has emphasized his efforts on several liberal policy priorities, including gun control, equal pay for women, alleviating student loan debt and increasing access to affordable health care.   Morganelli\u2019s candidacy has drawn the ire of progressive groups, with the pro-choice group EMILY\u2019s List and NextGen America, a group founded and funded by billionaire Tom Steyer, spending money to attack Morganelli.   On social media, Morganelli appeared highly critical of the liberal and progressive movements and took positions seemingly at odds even with the Democratic Party, a CNN KFile review reveals.   In a series of now-deleted tweets that are available on the Wayback Machine, Morganelli called on Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign, citing his \u201cmisguided liberalism.\u201d   \u201cRahm Emanuel should immediately resign as Mayor. He is incapable of protecting his citizens. Misguided liberalism at work,\u201d Morganelli wrote on January 3, 2017 in a tweet to Donald Trump\u2019s twitter account.   Two days later, Morganelli again wrote that Emanuel should resign.   \u201cChicago is a mess. Rahm must resign. Obama should send in feds like he does when police use force,\u201d he wrote.   On January 2, 2017 Morganelli sent a tweet blasting progressives, writing, \u201cThe progressives who believe they are so open to ideas are the least tolerant of anyone who disagrees with them.\u201d   Morganelli told CNN\u2019s KFile in a phone interview that he had other people working on his campaign who ran his Twitter account now, so he couldn\u2019t speak for the deleted tweets, but said he stood by the sentiment.   \u201cI do believe some progressives who believe that they want everyone to be tolerant of some things are very intolerant of other people\u2019s opinions, so I do believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in action, personally.\u201d   In November 2016, Morganelli also sent a series of tweets, which have been reported on in local media, offering praise to Trump.   \u201cThankful for your coming leadership. Waiting to hear from transition. Met you at Bedminister (sic) when I played in Member Guest,\u201d he wrote on November 24, 2016.   \u201cPres-elect sent personal note to my son. I worked with Barletta and Kobach against illegal immigration. Pa. most senior DA,\u201d he said in a November 20, 2016 tweet.

John Gibbs is a former conservative commentator who initially joined the HUD as the director for Strong Cities and Strong Communities, a program aimed at spurring economic development at the local level.   In August of 2017, Gibbs, a political appointee, transitioned to the role of senior adviser, working in the office of the assistant secretary for community planning and development. In his current role, Gibbs is tasked with developing and implementing efforts aimed at increasing economic development programs for low-income people.   On Twitter, Gibbs made multiple references to a conspiracy theory started by far-right bloggers claiming Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta took part in a Satanic ritual. Tweets from Gibbs, archived on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, show him promoting the conspiracy four times between October 31 and November 5 of 2016, using the hashtag #SpiritCooking. The hashtag originated from an email of Podesta\u2019s released by WikiLeaks, which members of the far-right claimed, without evidence, that Podesta was involved in a Satanic ritual that involved bodily fluids.   The claim has repeatedly been debunked.   A spokesman for the department declined to comment, saying the agency doesn\u2019t weigh in on comments not made as a public official. Gibbs did not return a request for comment.   Gibbs\u2019 Twitter page is now set to private, which means the general public can\u2019t see his full history of tweets. Tweets archived on the Wayback Machine only offer a small window into his Twitter activity.   When radio host Wayne Dupree, who is known for spreading a conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax, tweeted that Clinton was losing black voters\u2019 support because her campaign manager took part in \u201cSatanic #SpiritCooking,\u201d Gibbs quote tweeted him, writing, \u201cTrue, true, and true. #Trump #SpiritCooking #BlackLivesMatter.\u201d   In another tweet, Gibbs targeted artist Marina Abramovic, whom bloggers claimed was part of the conspiracy, writing, \u201cMarina Abramovic, woman at the center of #SpiritCooking scandal, has a Twitter handle that ends in 666. You can\u2019t make this stuff up.\u201d   In tweets from early 2016, Gibbs also blasted \u201ccucks,\u201d a derogatory term used by the alt-right to insult establishment conservatives, and derided the Democratic Party for accepting Islam.   When far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos was facing backlash for comments he made endorsing sex between young boys and older men, Gibbs called the comment \u201cindefensible,\u201d but added the controversy might \u201ctame his ego a bit, and helps focus his outrageousness on leftists & cucks, not the good guys.\u201d   In another tweet from October 2016, Gibbs also defended Ricky Vaughn, an alt-right figure who often tweeted anti-Semitic sentiments, when Twitter banned Vaughn, an anonymous user, from the platform.   \u201c#Twitter down big today because they banned Ricky? #FreeRicky,\u201d he wrote.   In a February 2016 tweet, Gibbs said the Democratic Party had become the party of \u201cIslam, gender-bending, anti-police\u201d and the party of people who accuse others of racism.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Wicker has said that he does \u201cnot condone the actions or statements of anyone who espouses the views\u201d of the CCC and that he regret if his appearance lent credibility to its activities and to the attitudes and beliefs that have been attributed to this organization.

The line echoed a claim Trump himself made during the 2016 campaign, in which he falsely placed blame on Clinton and her 2008 campaign for starting the birther conspiracy.   Trump repeatedly and publicly cast doubt that Obama was born in the US and challenged Obama multiple times to release his birth certificate.   Obama ultimately released a long-form birth certificate showing he was born in Hawaii. Even after this, Trump continued to suggest that the birth certificate was a forgery.

The removal of accounts and posts comes at a time when Congress will examine Bridenstine's record in the lead-up to his confirmation hearing.  Social media accounts and postings belonging to President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to be NASA administrator were deleted this year, a CNN KFile review has found.   Radio interviews and videos featuring Trump\u2019s nominee, Rep. Jim Bridenstine, were also removed from public view.   Trump on Friday nominated Bridenstine, a Republican from Oklahoma, to lead the nation\u2019s space agency after months of rumors he was the favorite for the position.   His nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, has already received bipartisan pushback from Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Democratic Sen.

Facebook, YouTube and Twitter accounts belonging to Bridenstine\u2019s campaign have been deleted entirely. Several posts on the Facebook page of Bridenstine\u2019s congressional office have also been deleted.   The congressman\u2019s Soundcloud account now only hosts two radio interviews with the congressman, but a search of the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine and the Google Cache show there used to be several radio interviews available on the account. Some of the missing interviews appear to be with conservative talk radio hosts like Mark Levin and Laura Ingraham.   Matthew Rydin, a spokesperson for Bridenstine, said the campaign Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube were deleted because his office was getting questions about whether Bridenstine was standing by his pledge to only serve three terms, which he is.   \u201cHe is not campaigning for any office, so no reason to maintain the campaign accounts,\u201d Rydin said.   Bridenstine\u2019s spokesperson also said that some of the congressman\u2019s radio interviews on Soundcloud might have been dropped as a result of a downgrade in the amount of storage space available on the account. However, according to a Soundcloud FAQ, Soundcloud says it does not delete files if you downgrade to a free account but hides the oldest uploads that exceed the upload limit of three hours. The two tracks currently on Bridenstine\u2019s account total 38 minutes.   Bridenstine\u2019s office did not respond to follow up questions about the Soundcloud account.   The spokesperson did not address the deleted posts on Bridenstine\u2019s congressional Facebook page.   Several videos on the congressman\u2019s congressional YouTube account were also set to private at some point.

In his writings, Clovis directed most of his ire at then-President Obama and the progressive movement.  Sam Clovis, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to be the Department of Agriculture\u2019s chief scientist, maintained a now-defunct blog for years in which he accused progressives of \u201censlaving\u201d minorities, called black leaders \u201crace traders,\u201d and labeled former President Barack Obama a \u201cMaoist\u201d with \u201ccommunist\u201d roots.   Clovis, a long-time Iowa political activist and former economics professor, wrote the blog posts on the now-deleted website for his radio show \u201cImpact with Clovis,\u201d which aired for several years on Sioux City KSCJ. Copies of the show are not available online, but the blog is archived on The Internet Archive Wayback Machine. Most of the available blog posts are from 2011 and 2012.   Trump\u2019s nomination of Clovis, a fervent supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign, has drawn criticism from Senate Democrats and climate activists, who have attacked his lack of scientific credentials and skepticism of climate science.   Clovis is currently serving as the senior White House adviser to the USDA, but as his old blog posts highlight, his background is strongly rooted in the politics of conservative talk radio. His nomination requires Senate confirmation.   Clovis did not respond to an email from CNN\u2019s KFile requesting comment. A spokesperson for the USDA said, \u201cDr. Clovis is a proud conservative and a proud American. All of his reporting either on the air or in writing over the course of his career has been based on solid research and data. He is after all an academic.\u201d   A spokesperson for the White House did not return a request for comment.   In his writings, Clovis directed most of his ire at then-President Obama and the progressive movement.   In a post from September 2011, Clovis wrote in reference to Obama, \u201cHe was brought up by socialists to be a socialist.  His associations were socialists or worse, criminal dissidents who were bent on overthrowing the government of the United States. He has no experience at anything other than race baiting and race trading as a community organizer.\u201d   The month before, Clovis said the 2012 Republican primary candidates needed to call out progressives for what they were \u2014 \u201cliars, race traders and race \u2018traitors.\u2019\u201d   At times, Clovis adopted a conspiratorial tone in his blog postings, openly pondering whether the Obama Administration would place conservative activists on a kill list that included terrorists like Anwar al-Awlaki and accusing Obama-era czars of using taxpayer money to buy the support of academics who would claim science was settled.   In one blog post in April 2011, Clovis contrasted the successful recovery efforts following the 2008 floods in Iowa with the chaos in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, attributing the difference to Iowa\u2019s culture \u201cfocused on family, community and the primacy of faith in life.\u201d   Clovis wrote in September 2011 that then-President Obama had \u201cno experience at anything other than race baiting and race trading as a community organizer.\u201d   \u201cThe president, like the rest of us, is clearly a product of his upbringing, his associates, his education and his experience,\u201d wrote Clovis. \u201cHe was brought up by socialists to be a socialist.  His associations were socialists or worse, criminal dissidents who were bent on overthrowing the government of the United States. He has no experience at anything other than race baiting and race trading as a community organizer. He has never run anything.  Finally, his education at some of the best colleges in America was deeply influenced by socialists or worse on those campuses. He supposedly earned degrees in political science and law, but his actions reflect a shallow education and chronic underachievement in nearly every thing he has done.\u201d   In August 2011, Clovis wrote progressives were \u201cliars, race traders, and race \u2018traitors.\u2019\u201d   \u201cMy caller was most concerned about the fact that our candidates seem to be afraid of taking on the race baiting,\u201d Clovis wrote. \u201cI could not agree more.  The current crop of candidates need to get that titanium spine we keep hearing about and call out the progressives for what they are \u2013 liars, race traders and race \u2018traitors.\u2019\u201d   In the same blog post, Clovis said Democrats were attempting to keep minorities \u201censlaved\u201d to the government. He said progressives wanted to eliminate people of color from America but saw government enslavement as a second option.   \u201cWe can go back 100 years and trace how the progressives, socialists and fellow travelers have done everything possible to keep minorities in this country enslaved to government.  This is particularly true in the African-American community.  The progressives have systematically attacked the individual, the black family unit, the black female and the black male to essentially eliminate people of color from the American landscape.  Because elimination has become impractical, subservience to government is an acceptable second option.   In June 2011, Clovis wrote that civil rights icon W. E. B. Du Bois was \u201cthe first race-trader\u201d for getting southern blacks to support Woodrow Wilson for President. (DuBois supported Wilson during the 1912 election, but later broke with him during his presidency.)   \u201cAfter the Civil War, African-Americans voted almost en masse for Republicans,\u201d wrote Clovis. \u201cThat all changed in the election of 1912 when first term governor Woodrow Wilson was able to convince WEB(sic) DeBois to back his candidacy. That year, 60% of eligible African-Americans voted for Wilson. This loss of a small but homogeneous voting block to the other side hurt the Republicans and would continue to hurt them until the present day.  DeBois was the first race-trader and did a magnificent job of convincing his fellow blacks to back a southern racist for president.  What ever was the deal that would allow someone of DeBois\u2019s stature to side with such an incredibly flawed individual?  To this day, I have not been able to find adequate scholarly work to explain this remarkable shift in allegiance.  Wilson was a progressive and a racist.  In my books, the two were, are, and will remain, synonomous(sic).\u201d   Clovis said the minority community would some day \u201cwake up\u201d to their enslavement.   \u201cLike putting the frog in the pot then turning up the heat, minorities have been enslaved by government operatives who care nothing for the nation and everything for power,\u201d wrote Clovis. \u201cSomeday, men and women of color will wake up to the incredible deception that has been visited on their communities.  Someday, these wonderful, courageous Americans will rebuff collective dependency and will embrace individual accountability and the covenant we find in our Constitution.   In other blog posts, Clovis repeatedly argued that progressives were attempting to enslave citizens to the government.   \u201cThey want power for an elite group of individuals who want to perfect man through constant social engineering,\u201d Clovis wrote in July 2011. \u201cThese same people want to enslave people in a way of life that drains the very heart out of an individual, destroys the family, dismantles the efficacy of religion in our lives and destroys the fabric that holds our communities together.  Through radical egalitarianism, progressives will take from those who produce and will give to those who will not\u2013in turn enslaving both.  There is nothing moral about slavery, and progressives want just that\u2013total dependence on the state.\u201d   Clovis pushed this sentiment repeatedly.   Clovis also expressed a deep disdain for former President Obama, who he said hated American greatness and had an \u201canti-American mentality.\u201d   \u201cThese must be desparate (sic) times for the president as he seems to be recognizing that perhaps there are people out here who do not like his policies and have really stopped liking him as a person,\u201d Clovis wrote in September 2011. \u201cHe is clearly a progressive socialist who hates the greatness of this nation and is doing all he can to make permanent changes in the structure of the country before he leaves office.\u201d   \u201cThe President, as Chief Executive, is responsible for this the lawlessness of his administration,\u201d wrote Clovis in a May 2011 blog post. \u201cWhat is perhaps most troubling is that the president clearly has disdain for the American people, American exceptionalism and the Constitution of this great nation.  He is a threat to our domestic tranquility and must be voted out of office at the earliest opportunity.\u201d   In multiple posts in January 2012, Clovis refers to President Obama as \u201ca Maoist\u201d and \u201canti-colonist.\u201d   \u201cBarack Obama is inherently dishonest, a pathological liar and a person who has surrounded himself with sycophantic, co-dependent people who are more clearly identified by their association with him than by their own accomplishments,\u201d wrote Clovis. \u201cHe is a Maoist, anti-colonialist who is also a pathological narcissist.  This is a very dangerous combination.\u201d   He wrote a week later, \u201cWe need to make sure we have done everything we can to beat Barack Hussein Obama and his progressive, Maoist, anti-colonialist followers.\u201d   Clovis wrote in May 2011 that unions came out of the \u201cCommunist closet\u201d to support socialist \u201cBarack Hussein Obama\u201d and wanted to seize the means of production.   \u201cThough it comes as no surprise, headlines today reveal that the National Education Association, the largest union in the United States, public or private, has asked its rank and file to support the re-election of Barack Obama.  Similarly, the Service Employees International Union came out of the communist closet over the weekend, letting the world know that they are fellow travelers in pursuit of seizing the means of production and irradicating(sic) personal property rights in our market system.  When one examines the reach of unions in America, one is startled to find out that some 15 million foot soldiers stand ready to march into battle for the socialist we now know is Barack Hussein Obama.\u201d   Clovis speculated in an October 2011 post that the US might start putting pro-life, small government activists on the same terrorist kill list as Anwar al-Awlaki.   \u201cOver the past three days on my radio show, we have been having a great discussion of the policies and consequences of the administration\u2019s latest actions in assassinating Anwar Al Awlaki.  Along with Al Awlaki, Samir Khan, an American citizen as well, died in the Predator attack that killed Al Awlaki while he was in Yemen.  What is not at issue is that Al Awlaki was a despicable human being who was bent on carrying out his jihad against America.  He was likely the individual behind the underwear bomber and the Fort Hood shootings.  Was he bad?  No Question.  However, he was an American citizen and he should have been extended his Constitutional protections.  What is frightening is that a panel of mid-level bureaucrats is determining who gets killed and who doesn\u2019t.  Are you comfortable with that?  I am not, particularly when this administration wants to Mirandize enemy combatants on the battlefield and wants to try foreign-born, non-citizen terrorists in federal court with all the protections of our most sacred civil document.  What am I missing here? This situation is not only indicative of being on a steep, slippery slope, but that we are sliding down this slope at breakneck speed.  We already have documentation that this administration thinks that returning veterans, pro-life advocates and small government advocates are all potential terrorists. This is written down in Department of Homeland Security policy documents.  Is it such a stretch to think that at some point that those who pose a threat to this administration might not move up the list generated by this secret panel? Possible? You bet. Probable? Who knows.\u201d   Clovis accused Obama-era czar\u2019s of buying academic support to say subjects of legislation were \u201csettled science.\u201d   \u201cAs we continue this discussion of the amorality of the progressive movement in the country, we must include discussion of how this administration has circumvented the law and the Constitution by establishing over 40 \u2018Czars\u2019 who have been charged with, among other things, ensuring support for administration positions by cooking the books,\u201d Clovis wrote in a June 2011 blog post. \u201cThe Czars are suspected of using taxpayer money to buy \u2018academic\u2019 support for controversial legislation.  By coordinating responses to issues, the administration can create the perception that what they are suggesting is \u201cmainstream\u201d or \u201csettled science\u201d or \u201csupported by rigorous studies.\u201d  Of course, none of what is being advanced is even close to what is mainstream, settled or otherwise researched.  By cooking the books and using taxpayer money to do it, this administration is conducting a nefarious, sinister propaganda campaign against the citizens they have sworn to protect.  One can do a lot of things in politics, but deceiving the American people is not one of them.  When the whole story of this is finally revealed, officials of this administration ought to be in jail.\u201d   Clovis wrote in April 2011 that a difference in culture is why people of Iowa reacted better to natural disasters than the people who faced Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.   \u201cMapleton suffered the worst of the damage,\u201d Clovis wrote. \u201cA large part of the town of 1200 was devastated by a F3 tornado that blew through about 7:30 pm.  The little town was shut down by law enforcement until around 2:30 in the morning so that power lines could be restored and gas lines could be secured.  By sunrise on Sunday morning, much of the situation had been contained and folks were already moving out into the little town to start the clean up.  By the time the governor showed up\u2013before noon\u2013the streets were clear and people were out in force cleaning yards and policing up the debris around town.  The power is back on but the gas lines will take a week or so to repair.  Not to worry, this is Iowa. This type of resilience is so typical of this part of the country.  From Texas to North Dakota and across the western part of the Midwest, the culture of this society is focused on family, community and the primacy of faith in life.  Each episode like this seems to end the same way\u2013neighbors helping neighbors get back to life as close to normal as possible.  Thus, the difference in the reaction of the people in Iowa to the floods of 2008 to that of the nation during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\u201d  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

The name of the client was not disclosed on Wray\u2019s biography. A spokesperson for King and Spalding declined to provide the name of client when asked, citing \u201cthe Rules of Professional Responsibility regarding client confidentiality.\u201d A DOJ spokesperson also would not provide further details.   King and Spalding said Wray made the change himself in January 2017 before he considered whether he might be nominated for any administration post.

At the time he made the adjustments \u2013 January 12, 2017 \u2013 he was not being considered for, and did not anticipate being nominated for, FBI Director, or any position in government,\u201d  Micheline Tang, a spokeswoman for the firm said. \u201cMoreover, the representation that was dropped from his online bio related to a matter where Chris, King & Spalding, and the client were adverse to the Russian Government.  Mr. Wray worked on this matter in 2006. Other attorneys at the firm worked on the matter in 2006, 2007, and 2011.\u201d   \u201cThe executive is an American citizen and lives in the United States,\u201d she continued. \u201cDuring the course of the dispute, the Russian government sought to exert leverage against this executive and the company by initiating a criminal investigation in Russia against him. Chris and the firm were engaged to handle the U.S. legal issues that arose from the situation.\u201d   Any work Wray did related to Russia is likely to be asked about at Senate confirmation hearings. King and Spalding has worked closely in the energy sector in Russia, according to the firm\u2019s website. The firm represented companies in deals with the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft and Gazprom.   Wray handled the 2006 case after serving as head of the criminal division at the Justice Department from 2003 to 2005 in the George W. Bush Administration. Weeks after President Trump abruptly fired James Comey as FBI director last month amid the bureau\u2019s Russia investigation, he settled on Wray as his nominee following the withdrawal of several candidates. His nomination must still be approved by the Senate.  \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

We have no choice,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have no choice.\u201d   Since stepping into office, though, Trump and his top aides have tried to distance themselves from the exact language of the plan, which has been used against the administration\u2019s attempt to suspend travel to seven \u2013 then six \u2013 Muslim-majority countries and suspend the admission of Syrian refugees into the United States.   US District Court Judge Theodore Chuang said in March, despite the Trump administration\u2019s comments about the order not being a Muslim ban, but rather a travel ban, he found \u201cthe history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the second executive order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban.\u201d   The Muslim-ban language remained online until Monday afternoon, when they were scrubbed from the website shortly after Spicer was pressed on why the plan was still on the President\u2019s campaign website.   \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask them. I know how we talked about this from the first day of this administration as a travel ban,\u201d not a Muslim ban, Spicer said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to make sure that people who are coming here are coming in here with the right motives and reasons, and that we\u2019re having a public safety aspect to making sure that we\u2019re protecting our people.\u201d   He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very consistent since the first day of this administration on this.\u201d   An administration spokesperson did not respond to questions about whether anyone from the White House asked that the language come down.

His glowing statements on Putin have become central in stoking the suspicion that he and his campaign were somehow connected to Russian interference in the election. A CNN KFile review of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public statements \u2014 from the years immediately before his presidential campaign to present \u2014 reveal that Trump has contradicted himself over the years about the nature of his relationship with Putin. Since 2013 \u2014 when Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Miss Universe pageant was held in Moscow \u2014 Trump has at least nine times claimed to have spoken to, met, or made contact with Putin. But as the 2016 campaign wore on and his statements on Putin began to attract more scrutiny, Trump changed course, denying having ever met the Russian president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never met Putin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said at a July 2016 news conference. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who Putin is.

I mean, their leaders are, whether you call them smarter or more cunning or whatever, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re outsmarting us. If you look at Syria or other places, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re outsmarting us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amid Russian aggression in Ukraine, Trump tells \"Fox and Friends\" that Mitt Romney was right about Russia being a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgeopolitical foe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\"Well Mitt Romney was so right, and nobody knew how right he was going to be, and you look at Obama's response and just take a look at what's going on,\" said Trump. \"Syria was propped up by Russia.

It turned out that he's absolutely right. You look at what Russia's doing with Iran, how they controlled the situation, and Syria, and virtually every other place that ... We were thrown out of every place. I'm not saying we should be there. We should rebuild our own schools and our own bridges and highways and everything else.

We've driven them into the arms of China, so that now these two are together, which is also a been the great sin. Don't ever let Russia and China get together. We've driven them together.

Vladimir Putin is going to want to really go after ISIS, and if he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a big shock to everybody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said.Still, in mentioning Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, he noted that Putin is \u00e2\u0080\u009can Assad person\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe United States doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like Assad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Told Bill O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Reilly that Putin was his \u00e2\u0080\u009cstablemate\u00e2\u0080\u009d on 60 Minutes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you know, I actually hosted it 10 years ago and Lorne Michaels called me up the other day. He said I'd love to have you host and I agreed to it because it's an honor. I did 60 Minutes last week \u2014 that was an honor. My stablemate was Vladimir Putin and we did very well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked a Republican debate what he would do as president in response to Russian aggression, Trump said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, first of all, it's not only Russia. We have problems with North Korea where they actually have nuclear weapons. You know, nobody talks about it, we talk about Iran, and that's one of the worst deals ever made. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So, we have more than just Russia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He went on to say, \"I got to know (Putin) very well because we were both on \u00e2\u0080\u009860 Minutes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 we were stablemates, and we did very well that night.

I think it's terrible \u2014 horrible. But, in all fairness to Putin, you're saying he killed people. I haven't' seen that. I don't know that he has. Have you been able to prove that? Do you know the names of the reporters that he's killed? Because I've been \u2014 you know, you've been hearing this, but I haven't seen the name. Now, I think it would be despicable if that took place, but I haven't' seen any evidence that he killed anybody in terms of reporters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump  tells Iowa radio host Simon Conway, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always had a good instinct about Putin.

But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always had a good feeling about him from the standpoint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump  says at an event in South Carolina that Putin says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrilliant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And attacks his opponents, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey want me to refute his statement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  In an interview with Fox Business\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Maria Bartiromo, Trump discusses the 2006 murder of  Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian security agent, and the 2016 findings of a British inquiry that Putin \u00e2\u0080\u009cprobably approved\u00e2\u0080\u009d his poisoning.  \"Have they found him guilty?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't think they've found him guilty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he did it, fine. But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that he did it. You know, people are saying they think it was him, it might have been him, it could have been him.

Perhaps it was personal. You know, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hurt his confidence. But I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Miss Universe contest \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is a big, incredible event, and incredible success.

They wanted me to disavow what he said. How dare you call me a genius. How dare you call me a genius, Vladimir. Wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it be nice if we actually got along with Russia?

You have Obama there. And frankly, that whole part of the world is a mess under Obama with all the strength that you're talking about and all of the power of NATO and all of this. In the meantime, he's going away. He takes Crimea.\" Trump again  says at a campaign rally in Green Bay that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know Putin and attacks Hillary Clinton for saying he wants to befriend him:\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I'm saying to myself what's wrong with that?

I've already said, he is really very much of a leader. I mean, you can say, 'Oh, isn't that a terrible thing' -- the man has very strong control over a country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, it's a very different system, and I don't happen to like the system. But certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said of Putin at a rally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in Nevada. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see how it works. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see. Maybe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a good relationship. Maybe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a horrible relationship. Maybe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a relationship right in the middle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump  said at presidential debate: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.

Trump says at a  rally in Ohio that it was not smart of Clinton to speak \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery badly of Putin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump tweets out Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criticism of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats: Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: \"In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity.\"  So true! Trump  says he believes Russia was responsible for the hacking the Democratic National committee in 2016:\"I think it was Russia,\" Trump said, adding that Putin \"should not be doing it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe won't be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I am leading it than when other people have led it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. Trump also said he believes a good relationship with Putin would be an asset.  \"If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia. Russia can help us fight ISIS, which, by the way, is, number one, tricky. I mean if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed.\"  Trump says he respects Putin during a Super Bowl interview with Bill O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Reilly. Trump defends Putin when O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Reilly calls him a killer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a lot of killers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump says.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think our country is so innocent? Do you think our country is so innocent? Trump  says  at a news conference that he has no deals in Russia:\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said.Trump adds, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you've had a lot of presidents that haven't taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can - now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But - but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d CNN's Tal Yellin, Ivory Sherman and Will Mullery contributed to this report.", "TV producer Marion Stokes\u2019 840,000 hours of news tapes to be archived | CNN": "Philadelphia woman started recording TV news onto cassette tapes in 1977 The collection \u2014 140,000 tapes in total \u2014 will be digitized into an online, public library The Internet Archive will handle the project, which will take several years and $2 million  Marion Stokes, a child of the Great Depression, spent her life saving everything \u2013 literally.   The Philadelphia resident kept everything from newspapers and electronics to empty cigarette packets and sticky-notes. Among the cardboard boxes and magazine stacks in her home were 140,000 cassette tapes containing recordings of all local and national TV news programs from every channel.   Stokes spent 35 years recording the news 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. That amounts to 840,000 hours of videotaped news.   With help from her family and a personal assistant, Stokes systematically recorded the news at her home until her death at age 83 in December 2012.   She left her collection of tapes\u2014 her \u201clife\u2019s work\u201d\u2014 to her only son, Michael Metelits. She gave him no specific instruction but told him that he could donate them to a charity of his choice.   On Tuesday, Stokes\u2019 cassette tapes will arrive at the Internet Archive, a nonprofit organization in California, after a cross-country journey in four large shipping containers. The organization will digitize all 140,000 tapes into a public, searchable online archive. The $2 million project will take about 20 digitizing machines, volunteers working around the clock, funding and several years to complete, Metelits said.   Metelits said he always knew what his mother wanted to do with the tapes.   He called his mother a private yet persistent woman who believed that if the public had access to good information, they would make good decisions. Stokes, a TV producer, librarian and political activist, took it upon herself to preserve hundreds of thousands of hours of televised news in hopes of one day making these tapes a repository of knowledge available to the public.   Now, nearly one year after her death, Metelits is finishing what his mother started in 1977 when she bought her first videotape recorder.   \u201cI feel confident that maintaining a family connection and supporting the archive to whatever degree we can and working with them, we\u2019re helping preserve my mother\u2019s legacy,\u201d said Metelits, who temporarily moved back to Philadelphia from London before Stokes died.   It took some time to decide on a home for his mother\u2019s tapes, and Metelits worried the entire collection would be too big of a project for one organization. He was overjoyed when the Internet Archive\u2019s director, Roger Macdonald, said the group would take them all.   \u201cI almost teared up at how grateful I was. It\u2019s just amazing that someone can use everything that my mother did,\u201d Metelits said.   For several years, Stokes and her husband traveled back and forth between houses in Philadelphia and Boston, until finally settling permanently in Philadelphia in the late 1980s. But this didn\u2019t prevent Stokes from recording the news; in fact, it allowed her to document historical events like the Boston busing crisis.   It\u2019s this unique collection of local and national news that makes Stokes\u2019 tapes so \u201cremarkable,\u201d wrote Macdonald in a blog post for the Internet Archive.   \u201cHer dream of using this collection for the public good can now be fulfilled,\u201d Macdonald wrote.
