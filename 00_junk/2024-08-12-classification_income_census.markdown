categories: ml, ai

An evaluation of different classification models based off an open-source income census dataset.

<h2> Topic Introduction </h2>

<h2> Data Source and Type </h2>

Data-readiness? Missing data, bad features?

Insert histograms (numeric) and bar charts (object/classification)

Insert heatmap (first-look investigatory take)

<h2> Classification Model Types </h2>

Logistic Regression, Svm, random forest

for curiosity's sake, investigate cluster models for target variables


<h2> Regression Model Types </h2>

To predict a continuous variable, a selection of 6 popular introductory regression models are considered and their performances evaluted; these models are linear regression (lr), random forest (rf), ridge regression (ridge), lasso regression (lasso), partial least squares regression (plsr), and support vector regression (svr).
